# Decimus: Character Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Decimus Valerius Rufus  
**Age:** 52 years  
**Rank:** Primus Pilus (Senior Centurion)  
**Current Assignment:** Second-in-command to Titus Aelius Gallus at the primary Roman military encampment on the Danube frontier  
**Physical Appearance:** Stocky and powerfully built despite his age, standing at medium height (5'7"). Face weathered by decades of outdoor campaigns, with a network of scars including a prominent one that has partially collapsed his right ear. Close-cropped gray hair and a short beard peppered with white. Missing two teeth from a battle injury, visible when he smiles, which is rare in official settings.  
**Distinguishing Features:** Walks with a pronounced limp from an old thigh wound that never properly healed. Bears a legionary tattoo on his forearm (SPQR) now faded and stretched with age. Hands permanently calloused from decades of weapons training and practical work.

## Background and History

Unlike Titus, Decimus comes from humble origins—the son of a farmer from northern Italy who joined the legions to escape rural poverty. He enlisted as a common legionary at sixteen, expecting to serve his twenty-five years and retire with land and citizenship. Instead, he discovered an aptitude for military life that led to a career spanning over three decades.

His rise through the ranks came slowly but steadily, earned through consistent competence rather than spectacular heroism. Beginning as an ordinary legionary, he advanced to immunis (specialist exempt from routine duties) based on his skill with the gladius, then to tesserarius (guard commander), optio (centurion's assistant), and finally centurion. His promotion to primus pilus—the senior centurion of a legion and highest rank a non-aristocratic soldier could typically achieve—came after distinguished service during the Parthian campaign.

Decimus has served under Titus for nearly twenty years, their relationship beginning when Titus was a junior officer and Decimus already an experienced centurion. Their complementary skills—Titus's strategic thinking and diplomatic abilities paired with Decimus's tactical expertise and connection to the common soldiers—created an effective partnership that has survived multiple campaigns and countless battles.

Like Titus, Decimus contracted the Antonine Plague but survived, though the illness left him with occasional breathing difficulties that worsen in cold weather. This shared experience of survival amid widespread death strengthened their bond and gave both men a certain fatalistic outlook that influences their approach to subsequent challenges.

## Personality Traits

**Pragmatic:** Decimus evaluates situations based on practical outcomes rather than theory or tradition. He instinctively asks "Will this work?" rather than "Is this proper?" when assessing plans or orders, making him invaluable in adapting Roman military doctrine to frontier realities.

**Blunt:** He speaks directly and without political calculation, a trait that would have limited his advancement in Rome but proves valuable on the frontier where clarity outweighs diplomacy. This bluntness extends to his interactions with superiors, including Titus, though he adjusts his tone based on setting and audience.

**Observant:** Decades of battlefield experience have honed his ability to notice details others miss—slight changes in enemy formations, subtle indicators of troop morale, early signs of equipment failure. This observational skill extends to people, making him an excellent judge of character and motivation.

**Laconic:** Decimus uses words sparingly, expressing complex thoughts in brief, often sardonic statements. This economy of speech reflects both his practical nature and the command habit of giving clear, concise orders that cannot be misinterpreted in chaotic situations.

**Loyal:** Once earned, his loyalty remains unshakable. This applies primarily to individuals rather than abstract entities—he serves Rome because he serves Titus, not the reverse. This personal loyalty creates occasional tension when imperial directives conflict with what he perceives as his commander's best interests.

**Adaptable:** Despite his age and traditional training, Decimus demonstrates remarkable adaptability to changing circumstances. He readily incorporates effective enemy tactics into Roman operations and adjusts standard procedures to accommodate plague limitations without the resistance to innovation often found in career soldiers.

## Core Values and Beliefs

**Practical Competence:** Decimus values demonstrated ability over rank, education, or social standing. This meritocratic outlook makes him respected among common soldiers while creating occasional friction with aristocratic officers who expect deference based on birth rather than skill.

**Loyalty to Comrades:** His primary allegiance lies with fellow soldiers, particularly those under his direct command. This loyalty manifests in both small daily actions—ensuring proper equipment distribution, checking wound dressings personally—and larger ethical positions regarding acceptable risk and resource allocation.

**Survival Pragmatism:** Having risen from common ranks, Decimus maintains the frontline soldier's prioritization of survival over glory. He evaluates tactics primarily by their likelihood of preserving his men's lives while accomplishing necessary objectives, with little concern for how actions might be perceived in Rome.

**Earned Authority:** He believes authority must be earned through demonstrated competence and shared hardship rather than conferred by position alone. This principle guides his own leadership style and colors his response to orders from those he considers unproven.

**Experiential Knowledge:** Decimus trusts practical experience over theoretical knowledge, valuing lessons learned through direct observation and application above those derived from books or formal education. This sometimes creates tension with more educated officers, though not with Titus, who respects this perspective.

**Limited Horizon:** Unlike Titus or Marcus Aurelius, Decimus shows little concern for abstract concepts like Rome's historical destiny or philosophical questions about duty. His focus remains on immediate practical challenges and the welfare of those under his command, with limited interest in larger historical or political contexts.

## Internal Conflicts

**Loyalty vs. Survival:** Decimus occasionally faces conflict between his absolute loyalty to Titus and his pragmatic concern for troop survival. When Titus makes decisions prioritizing larger strategic objectives over immediate safety, Decimus struggles to reconcile his instinct to protect his men with his commitment to supporting his commander.

**Tradition vs. Innovation:** Despite his practical adaptability, Decimus sometimes experiences internal tension between traditional Roman military methods ingrained through decades of service and the innovations necessary for frontier warfare. This conflict manifests in momentary hesitations when implementing tactics that deviate significantly from his training.

**Resentment vs. Acceptance:** Having reached the highest rank available to someone of his background, Decimus occasionally harbors resentment toward the aristocratic system that limits advancement based on birth rather than merit. This resentment conflicts with his general acceptance of the Roman social order and creates ambivalence about the empire he serves.

**Age vs. Duty:** Advancing age and accumulating injuries create growing conflict between physical limitations and continued service. Pride prevents him from acknowledging these limitations publicly, while duty compels him to maintain performance standards that become increasingly difficult to sustain.

**Attachment vs. Command Distance:** Decimus struggles with the tension between genuine concern for soldiers under his command and the necessary emotional distance required to send them into danger. This conflict intensifies as plague losses force promotion of younger, less experienced men with whom he feels increasingly paternal despite command requirements for detachment.

## External Conflicts

**With Aristocratic Officers:** Decimus frequently clashes with officers from senatorial or equestrian backgrounds who lack frontier experience yet expect deference based on social rank. These conflicts typically remain below the surface, expressed through minimal compliance rather than open insubordination, but create ongoing tension within the command structure.

**With Military Bureaucracy:** The administrative requirements of the Roman military system—detailed reports, complex supply requisitions, personnel documentation—conflict with Decimus's preference for direct action. His impatience with paperwork creates friction with administrative staff and occasional information gaps that Titus must address.

**With Germanic Tactics:** The evolving battle approaches of Marcomanni and allied tribes present constant tactical challenges that conflict with traditional Roman military responses. Decimus must continually adapt century-level tactics to counter Germanic innovations while maintaining core Roman disciplinary and formation advantages.

**With Plague Limitations:** Manpower shortages and reduced unit effectiveness due to plague losses create external conflict between mission requirements and available resources. Decimus must accomplish essential security objectives with fewer and often less experienced troops than doctrine requires.

**With Environmental Challenges:** The harsh frontier environment—severe winters, spring flooding, summer disease outbreaks—creates ongoing external conflict that affects every aspect of military operations. Decimus's practical focus makes him the primary problem-solver for these environmental challenges despite their often intractable nature.

## Relationships

**With Titus Aelius Gallus:** Their relationship forms the core of Decimus's character, combining professional respect, personal loyalty, and complementary capabilities. He serves as Titus's practical conscience, tactical implementer, and occasional confidant. Their twenty-year association has created deep mutual understanding expressed more through action than words, with each anticipating the other's decisions in critical situations.

**With Common Soldiers:** Decimus maintains closer connection to ordinary legionaries than most officers of his rank, regularly walking among them during evening meals, knowing many by name, and addressing individual concerns directly rather than through the chain of command. This accessibility makes him the human face of leadership, particularly for new recruits intimidated by Titus's more reserved command presence.

**With Centurions:** As primus pilus, Decimus serves as both commander and mentor to the legion's centurions. He maintains this relationship through regular training sessions, practical advice delivered without condescension, and willingness to demonstrate techniques personally despite his age and rank. This hands-on leadership creates strong cohesion among the centurionate, crucial for battlefield effectiveness.

**With Marcus Aurelius:** During imperial visits to the frontier, Decimus maintains formal correctness but lacks the philosophical connection the emperor shares with Titus. He respects Marcus's willingness to endure frontier hardships despite poor health but remains skeptical of abstract philosophical approaches to practical military challenges.

**With Camp Prefect:** Decimus maintains a complex working relationship with the camp prefect responsible for logistics and administration. Their natural tension between operational needs and resource limitations is managed through gruff mutual respect and recognition of their interdependence, though disagreements about priorities occur regularly.

## Character Arc Potential

Decimus begins as the embodiment of practical Roman military virtue—competent, loyal, and focused on immediate challenges without broader philosophical questioning. His character arc involves gradual recognition that the military system he has served his entire life faces unprecedented challenges that cannot be addressed through traditional approaches alone.

Key developments in his potential arc include:

1. **Initial Resistance:** Early in the narrative, Decimus resists significant departures from established military doctrine despite frontier challenges, believing Roman methods require only minor tactical adjustments rather than fundamental reconsideration.

2. **Pragmatic Adaptation:** Mounting losses and plague impacts force recognition that traditional approaches cannot succeed under current conditions, leading him to support more significant innovations despite institutional resistance.

3. **Mentorship Focus:** As his own physical capabilities decline, Decimus increasingly emphasizes developing the next generation of centurions, shifting from direct battlefield leadership toward ensuring tactical knowledge transfers to younger officers.

4. **Broader Perspective:** Through continued association with Titus and occasional interactions with Marcus Aurelius, Decimus reluctantly develops more nuanced understanding of the larger historical context beyond immediate military concerns.

5. **Legacy Consideration:** By the narrative's conclusion, he confronts questions about the meaning of his lifetime of service as the empire he has defended shows signs of fundamental transformation beyond military solutions.

## Narrative Function

As a supporting character, Decimus serves multiple narrative functions:

**Practical Counterpoint:** His pragmatic perspective balances Titus's more strategic thinking and Marcus's philosophical approach, grounding abstract discussions in frontline realities.

**Common Soldier's Viewpoint:** Through Decimus, readers access the experience of ordinary legionaries whose perspectives would otherwise remain distant from the command-level narrative.

**Tactical Expositor:** His expertise provides natural opportunity to explain Roman military operations and their adaptation to frontier conditions without awkward expository passages.

**Loyalty Embodiment:** His unshakable loyalty to Titus despite occasional disagreements demonstrates the personal bonds that maintain military effectiveness beyond institutional structures.

**Change Measurement:** His gradual shift from traditional military thinking to innovative adaptation marks the broader transformation occurring within the Roman military system during this pivotal period.

## Speech and Expression Patterns

Decimus speaks with the direct, economical language of a career soldier accustomed to giving orders that must be immediately understood in chaotic situations. His speech patterns include:

- Brief, action-oriented sentences with minimal subordinate clauses
- Frequent use of military terminology and technical vocabulary related to weapons, formations, and tactics
- Occasional crude expressions drawn from barracks language, particularly when expressing disagreement
- Sardonic humor that emerges in tense situations, often through understated observations
- Regional accent from northern Italy that becomes more pronounced when emotional
- Preference for active rather than passive constructions, emphasizing direct responsibility

His non-verbal communication often conveys more than his words, with subtle changes in posture and expression signaling his assessment of situations before he speaks.

## Conclusion

Decimus Valerius Rufus embodies the practical military expertise and personal loyalty that sustained Roman frontier defense despite institutional challenges. His character combines the hardened professional soldier's focus on immediate effectiveness with growing awareness of larger historical changes beyond tactical solutions. Through his eyes, readers experience both the impressive discipline of Roman military organization and its increasing strain under unprecedented pressures, creating a character whose personal journey reflects the larger transformation of Rome's defensive capabilities during this pivotal historical moment.
