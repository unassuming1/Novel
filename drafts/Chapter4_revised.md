# Chapter 4: The Physician's Burden

Claudius Galenus moved through the infirmary with the quiet efficiency of a man who had treated thousands. The large tent serving as Carnuntum's medical facility had been expanded twice as winter illnesses swept through the camp. What began as space for twenty patients now held nearly fifty, with more arriving daily.

"Fever's broken," he noted, pressing his palm to a young legionary's forehead—the same soldier who'd been delirious last night. "Continue the willow bark every four hours. Broth if he wakes lucid."

The medical orderly—Demetrius, a former gladiator whose fighting career had ended with a crippled leg—made a notation on his wax tablet. Despite a face mapped with arena scars, Demetrius had revealed a gentle touch with patients and uncanny memory for treatment details.

"The scout from the river crossing?" Claudius asked, moving to the next pallet.

"Improving. Lungs clear, no fever. Woke twice in the night, took water and some broth."

Claudius nodded, satisfied. Immersion in the Danube's winter waters usually meant death, either from immediate cold shock or lung inflammation afterward. That Flavius had escaped both spoke to his youth and the swift treatment he'd received.

The physician continued his rounds—adjusting bandages on a soldier whose hand had been crushed during fortification work, examining a centurion's healing sword wound from training, checking the angry rash spreading across a cavalry officer's torso. Each patient received the same careful attention, regardless of rank.

As he worked, Claudius cataloged the patterns of illness. The respiratory ailments were winter campaign standards—cold, damp, and crowded quarters creating perfect breeding grounds. The injuries reflected the frantic preparation pace—men working too quickly or without rest, making mistakes that caution would have prevented.

But other cases gnawed at him more deeply. Three soldiers admitted in the past week showed symptoms uncomfortably reminiscent of the plague that had ravaged the empire years before—high fever, skin discoloration, bloody sputum. Two had died despite his best efforts; the third lay isolated at the tent's rear, deteriorating despite every treatment.

"The man from the Tenth Century?" Claudius asked quietly as they reached the screened-off area.

Demetrius's face darkened. "No change since midnight. Fever holds, breathing worse. Spots spreading across chest and face."

Claudius steeled himself before stepping behind the screen. Despite years of practice from Pergamon's gladiatorial schools to eastern campaign battlefields, cases like this still cut him—not just as professional challenges but as human suffering beyond his power to ease.

The patient lay slightly separated from the main ward. Young, perhaps twenty-five, with a soldier's build. His normally olive face now burned with fever except where dark purple spots had formed on his cheeks and forehead. Each breath came as a labored gasp, a visible struggle for air.

Claudius checked the pulse—rapid and weak. The skin burned despite cooling compresses. When he gently lifted an eyelid, the white showed yellow.

"Any consciousness?" Claudius asked.

"Briefly, near dawn," Demetrius replied. "Confused, calling for his mother. Took water before slipping away again."

Claudius nodded grimly. The progression matched the previous cases—and too many patients during the plague years. The disease followed its ruthless path: initial fever and malaise, then respiratory difficulty, skin eruptions, and eventually, in most cases, death from fluid-filled lungs and systemic collapse.

"Keep cooling him," he instructed. "Fever extract every two hours if he can swallow. If not, soak cloths in the solution and place them under his tongue. And Demetrius—"

"Yes, physician?"

"Full precautions for anyone attending him. Vinegar washing before and after, separate utensils, masks soaked in cedar infusion."

The orderly nodded, understanding. These were protocols developed during plague years—measures that seemed to reduce, though not eliminate, contagion risk among medical staff.

"Should I tell the prefect?" Demetrius asked quietly.

Claudius weighed the question. Three cases didn't necessarily signal a new plague outbreak. Similar symptoms could stem from other winter diseases. Creating premature alarm would damage morale at a critical time.

Yet if plague was returning, early action might contain it. The previous outbreak had taught brutal lessons—delay in recognition and response had allowed the disease to establish throughout the legions before effective measures began.

"Not yet," Claudius decided. "I'll examine his quarters and speak with his tent mates first. If there are more developing cases or clear contagion patterns, then we'll inform Prefect Gallus."

After completing rounds, Claudius returned to his quarters—a small but private space adjoining the infirmary. Unlike many traveling physicians who relied on locally available materials, Claudius maintained an extensive collection of instruments, reference scrolls, and pharmaceutical supplies. His position as the Emperor's personal physician granted resources most military doctors could only imagine.

He washed thoroughly with vinegar solution, changed his tunic, and sat at the small desk where he kept his medical journals. Recording observations was, to Claudius, as essential as diagnosis or treatment. Only through systematic documentation could patterns emerge, treatments be evaluated, and knowledge advance.

He unrolled fresh parchment and noted details of the three suspicious cases—age, previous health, legion assignment, symptom onset and progression, treatments attempted and their effects. As information took shape on the page, he searched for commonalities that might reveal source or transmission patterns.

All three men came from different centuries, with different duties and quarters. They hadn't, as far as he could determine, shared meals or training in the days before falling ill. The only connection he found was that all three had patrolled the river five days before the first man reported to the infirmary.

This could be significant. If disease had crossed the Danube with the tribes, it might explain some of the unusual movements Valerius and the other scouts had reported. Communities fleeing contagion would behave differently than those preparing for war, though the two weren't mutually exclusive.

A discreet knock interrupted his thoughts. "Enter," he called, setting aside his notes.

Titus Aelius Gallus stepped in, still wearing the light armor he favored for daily duties. The prefect looked exhausted, shadows beneath his eyes betraying another night without proper rest.

"Physician," Titus greeted him with a respectful nod. "I hope I'm not interrupting."

"Nothing that can't wait," Claudius replied, rising to offer his visitor the room's only comfortable chair. "Though I suspect you haven't come merely for conversation."

A faint smile crossed Titus's face. "Perceptive as always. No, I have questions—both personal and regarding the camp's health."

Claudius gestured for him to continue, expression attentive. As a physician, he fielded consultations ranging from individual ailments to concerns affecting entire communities.

"The personal matter first," Titus said, voice dropping though they were alone. "The headaches have returned, worse than before. Three this past week, each lasting hours. Can't bear light, stomach turns, can't focus on reports."

Claudius nodded, unsurprised. Titus had suffered severe headaches for years, worsening during times of stress or after insufficient rest. The current frontier crisis provided ample cause for both.

"You've been using the feverfew preparation?" he asked.

"When possible," Titus confirmed. "Helps somewhat if taken early. But lately they strike suddenly, full force with barely any warning."

"And sleep?"

A dismissive gesture. "What the situation allows."

"Which is clearly insufficient," Claudius observed dryly. "The connection between exhaustion and these headaches has been well-established in your case, Prefect. Medicine can only compensate so much for the body's neglected needs."

Titus accepted the mild rebuke with a nod. Unlike many commanders who viewed physical limitations as weaknesses to be overcome through will alone, he had learned to respect medical counsel, even when circumstances made it difficult to follow.

"I'll prepare something stronger," Claudius decided. "Take it at the first sign, with a smaller preventive dose each morning. But understand it treats the symptom, not the cause. Without adequate rest, your condition will worsen."

"Rest comes when the frontier is secure," Titus replied, their familiar refrain in the ongoing negotiation over his health. "Now, the broader concern. How stands the camp's health?"

Claudius considered his response carefully. As a physician, his first loyalty was to truth and his patients' wellbeing. Yet he understood the military realities Titus balanced—the need for accurate information without creating panic that might undermine morale or readiness.

"The usual winter ailments are spreading predictably," he began. "Respiratory infections, digestive complaints from preserved rations, injuries from construction and training. Nothing significantly impacting overall readiness."

He paused, weighing his next words. "There are, however, three cases warranting closer attention. Symptoms reminiscent of the plague—high fever, respiratory distress, characteristic skin eruptions. Two have died; the third likely won't survive the day."

Titus's expression remained controlled, but Claudius noted the slight tightening around his eyes—the only visible reaction to news that could threaten everything.

"You're certain?" Titus asked quietly.

"Not yet," Claudius admitted. "Similar symptoms can arise from other conditions. But the progression matches what we saw during the outbreak years."

"And the risk of spread?"

"Unknown, but concerning. All three men served on river patrol five days before symptoms appeared. If the disease crossed from the northern tribes..."

Titus absorbed this, his mind clearly working through implications. "The scouts reported abandoned villages. We assumed preparation for conflict, but if they're fleeing disease..."

"It would explain certain patterns," Claudius agreed. "Though it doesn't preclude military intentions as well. People facing multiple threats often make complex decisions."

The prefect rose and paced the small room, hands clasped behind his back. "Recommendations?"

"Isolate any new cases showing similar symptoms. Implement hygiene protocols throughout the camp—more frequent bathing, vinegar washing of common areas, separate utensils for the ill. Limit unnecessary gatherings where contagion might spread."

"And if it is the plague returning?"

Claudius met his gaze directly. "Then we face difficult decisions. Full quarantine measures would significantly impact military readiness. Yet without them, we risk losing more men to disease than we might to enemy action."

Titus nodded grimly. "Monitor the situation closely. I want daily reports, more frequently if new cases appear. For now, implement your hygiene recommendations as 'winter health measures' without specific mention of plague concerns."

"And the river patrols?" Claudius asked. "If that's indeed the transmission vector?"

"We can't abandon river surveillance, not with tribal movements detected," Titus said. "But we can rotate personnel more frequently and implement your precautions for returning patrols."

Their discussion was interrupted by a sharp knock. Before either could respond, the door opened and Decimus entered, his expression urgent.

"Forgive the intrusion, Prefect, but you're needed immediately. A messenger from Sirmium has arrived with imperial dispatches marked for your eyes only."

Titus straightened, instantly alert. "From the Emperor himself?"

"So it appears. The messenger bears Marcus Aurelius's personal seal and insists on delivering directly to you."

"I'll come at once." Titus turned back to Claudius. "Prepare your recommendations in detail. We'll continue this discussion after I've dealt with this new development."

After they departed, Claudius returned to his notes, adding the new information about river patrols as potential disease vectors. If his suspicions proved correct, the frontier situation was even more complex than it had appeared. Not merely a military threat gathering beyond the river, but potentially a medical crisis that recognized no boundaries between Roman and barbarian.

He had seen the devastation plague could wreak—entire communities decimated, military units rendered combat-ineffective, social structures strained to breaking. If the disease was indeed returning, containing it would require measures that might conflict with military necessities.

Yet there was also opportunity in crisis. If the tribes beyond the river faced the same threat, perhaps common ground existed. Disease recognized no political boundaries, no military allegiances. It struck Roman and barbarian alike, creating a shared enemy that might—just might—open possibilities for cooperation rather than conflict.

Claudius shook his head at his own thoughts. Such considerations were beyond a physician's purview. His task was to heal the sick and protect the healthy, not to contemplate diplomatic implications. Yet having served in multiple campaigns, he understood that health concerns and military matters were inextricably linked, each influencing the other in ways that commanders sometimes failed to appreciate.

He rose and began preparing the stronger headache remedy for Titus. Whatever imperial news had arrived from Sirmium, the prefect would need a clear head to address it—especially if it required decisions about both the gathering tribal forces and the potential disease threat.

As he worked, grinding dried herbs with practiced precision, Claudius found himself thinking of his teacher in Pergamon, who had often said that physicians must understand not just bodies but the circumstances in which those bodies existed. "Context shapes health as surely as humoral balance," the old man had insisted. "Treat the patient, not merely the disease."

Here on the frontier, the context was one of multiple, intersecting threats—military, environmental, and now potentially epidemic. Addressing any one in isolation risked exacerbating the others. The challenge would be finding approaches that acknowledged these connections rather than ignoring them.

The remedy prepared, Claudius sealed it in a small pottery container and set it aside for delivery to the prefect's quarters. Then he returned to his examination of the plague-like cases, determined to establish whether they truly represented the return of that dreaded disease or merely an unfortunate coincidence of similar symptoms.

Either way, the coming days would test not just the frontier's military defenses but its medical ones as well. And in Claudius's experience, the latter often proved more challenging than the former.

Later that afternoon, Claudius made his way to the barracks that had housed the three affected soldiers. The centurion in charge, a veteran named Lucius Cassius, met him at the entrance, his weathered face showing concern beneath professional composure.

"Physician," he greeted Claudius with a respectful nod. "The prefect sent word you'd be coming. The men have been instructed to cooperate fully."

"Thank you, Centurion. I'll need to examine the sleeping quarters and speak with anyone who shared close proximity with the affected men."

Cassius led him through the barracks—a long wooden structure divided into sections, each housing eight men who served in the same contubernium, the smallest unit of the legion. The quarters were spartan but orderly, with equipment neatly stored and bedding rolled when not in use.

"The three men came from different sections," Cassius explained, gesturing to widely separated areas of the barracks. "Different duties, different meal rotations. The only commonality was their assignment to river patrol five days before the first fell ill."

This confirmed what Claudius had already noted in his records. "And the patrol itself? What exactly did it entail?"

"Standard surveillance along our section of the Danube. Checking for unusual activity on the far bank, monitoring ice conditions, ensuring no unauthorized crossings in either direction."

"Did they encounter anyone from across the river? Any direct contact with people or objects from the northern side?"

The centurion frowned, considering. "Not according to their reports. They observed abandoned settlements on the far bank but made no contact with tribal populations."

"What about the river water itself? Any immersion, drinking, unusual exposure?"

"Nothing reported, though..." Cassius paused. "There was mention of collecting ice samples from different points along the river. The engineers requested them to test thickness and composition, planning for potential defensive measures if the river freezes completely."

This was new information, potentially significant. "So they handled river ice directly? With bare hands?"

"Likely so. Standard procedure would be to chip samples with tools, then transport them in leather pouches."

Claudius nodded thoughtfully. If the river itself carried contagion—perhaps from infected bodies or waste upstream—direct contact with ice or water could explain transmission without person-to-person contact.

He proceeded to examine the sleeping areas of each affected soldier, finding nothing immediately suspicious. The quarters were no more crowded or unsanitary than typical for winter barracks. Personal belongings were few and showed no obvious signs of contamination.

Next, he interviewed the men who had shared quarters with the victims. Most reported no unusual symptoms themselves, though several mentioned mild headaches or throat irritation they had attributed to normal winter conditions. Claudius instructed them to report immediately to the infirmary if these symptoms worsened or if fever developed.

One soldier, however, provided information that caught Claudius's attention. Marcus Vitellius, a young legionary who had bunked beside the third victim, recalled a detail from the river patrol that hadn't appeared in official reports.

"Antonius mentioned they found something strange in one of the abandoned villages across the river," Vitellius said, referring to his now-critically ill tent mate. "Not in his formal report—just something he told me the night after they returned. Said they found piles of ash that didn't look like normal cooking or heating fires. Too large, he said, and placed away from the settlements."

"Burning piles?" Claudius asked, immediately alert. "Did he describe them in more detail?"

Vitellius shrugged. "Just said they were big, with what looked like charred bones mixed in. He thought maybe some kind of tribal ritual or sacrifice. Didn't think much of it myself—barbarians do all sorts of strange things."

But Claudius thought a great deal of it. During the height of the plague years, burning the dead had become standard practice in affected areas—not as ritual but as practical necessity when bodies accumulated faster than they could be properly buried. If the tribes were burning their dead in large pyres outside settlements, it strongly suggested they faced epidemic disease.

And if the patrol had approached these sites, perhaps even examined them closely...

"Did Antonius or the others mention getting close to these ash piles? Touching anything, breathing the smoke?"

"He didn't say specifically," Vitellius replied. "But knowing Antonius, he would have investigated thoroughly. He was always thorough, especially when something unusual caught his attention."

Claudius thanked the soldier and continued his investigation, but his mind kept returning to this new information. If the patrol had indeed been exposed to remains of plague victims—even just ash and bone fragments—it could explain the disease transmission without direct contact with living carriers.

By the time he finished at the barracks, the winter day was already fading toward dusk. Claudius made his way back to the infirmary, his concern deepening with each step. The evidence increasingly suggested not coincidental cases but the beginning of potential outbreak—one that might have crossed the frontier from tribal territories already experiencing the disease's effects.

At the infirmary, Demetrius met him with news he had been expecting but dreading nonetheless.

"The man from the Tenth Century has died, physician," the orderly reported quietly. "And we have two new cases with similar symptoms—a cook from the officers' mess and a cavalry scout who returned yesterday from perimeter duty."

Claudius absorbed this with outward calm, though inwardly his concern sharpened to alarm. The cook had likely had no contact with the river patrol, suggesting the disease had already begun spreading within the camp. And the cavalry scout represented potential wider transmission beyond Carnuntum itself, if he had visited other outposts before symptoms appeared.

"Full isolation protocols for the new cases," he instructed. "And I need to speak with Prefect Gallus immediately. The situation has become more urgent."

As Demetrius went to prepare the isolation area, Claudius quickly reviewed his notes, organizing the evidence to present to Titus. The prefect would need clear information to make difficult decisions—decisions that would balance military necessity against medical reality, immediate tactical concerns against longer-term strategic threats.

The plague had changed the course of campaigns before. It could do so again, regardless of human plans or preferences. The question now was not whether they would respond, but how—and whether that response would come quickly enough to make a difference.

---

Titus Aelius Gallus stood at the window of his quarters, reading the imperial dispatch for the third time. The fading winter light made the task difficult, but he was reluctant to call for lamps just yet. The message from Marcus Aurelius required careful consideration, away from the curious eyes of even his most trusted officers.

The Emperor's instructions were clear but raised as many questions as they answered. Arminius, the Marcomanni war chief, had apparently sent his own message to Sirmium—a proposal for dialogue rather than immediate conflict. Marcus Aurelius, ever the philosopher as well as emperor, saw potential value in such communication, particularly given the complex situation developing along the frontier.

*Explore this opening, but with appropriate caution,* the Emperor had written. *If genuine opportunity exists to resolve the frontier situation without major bloodshed, Rome's interests are served by its pursuit. Yet be vigilant against deception or delay tactics that might allow further tribal consolidation while we stand idle.*

The timing aligned almost perfectly with Valerius's report of his encounter with Arminius and the war chief's request for a meeting. That both messages had arrived nearly simultaneously suggested coordination rather than coincidence—Arminius had apparently sent emissaries to both Carnuntum and Sirmium, ensuring his proposal would be considered at multiple levels of Roman authority.

A knock at the door interrupted Titus's contemplation. "Enter," he called, setting aside the imperial dispatch.

Claudius Galenus stepped into the room, his expression grave enough that Titus immediately knew the medical situation had deteriorated.

"More cases?" he asked without preamble.

The physician nodded. "Two new ones with identical symptoms. The third original case has died. And I've discovered information suggesting the disease is indeed crossing the frontier from tribal territories."

Titus gestured for him to continue, listening intently as Claudius detailed his findings—the river patrol's exposure to ash piles that likely represented tribal plague victims, the new cases indicating spread within the camp, the potential for wider transmission if not contained quickly.

When the physician finished his report, Titus remained silent for a long moment, weighing this new information against the imperial dispatch and Valerius's earlier report. Pieces that had seemed disconnected began to form a more coherent picture—one that suggested the tribal movements might be driven by plague as much as by military ambition.

"Your recommendations?" he finally asked.

"Immediate implementation of full containment protocols," Claudius replied without hesitation. "Isolation of all cases showing suspicious symptoms. Camp-wide hygiene measures. Restriction of movement between different sections of the camp. Careful screening of all patrols returning from the field, especially those with river contact."

"And the military implications of such measures?"

"Significant," Claudius acknowledged. "Reduced operational capacity in the short term. Potential impact on morale. Disruption to training and preparation activities. But the alternative is potentially worse—a full-scale outbreak that could render the legion combat-ineffective regardless of tribal intentions."

Titus nodded slowly. "Implement your recommendations, but with one modification. Frame it as precautionary measures against winter illness, not specific response to potential plague. I want no panic, no rumors spreading beyond our walls."

"And the river patrols?"

Here Titus paused, considering the complex intersection of medical and military necessities. "Continue but with enhanced precautions. No direct contact with river water or ice. No approach to abandoned settlements or burning sites. And full decontamination procedures upon return."

Claudius seemed about to object to the continuation of patrols but apparently thought better of it. "Understood, Prefect. I'll establish the protocols immediately."

"There's something else you should know," Titus said, making a decision. "Something that may connect to your findings."

He briefly summarized the messages from both Valerius and the Emperor regarding Arminius's request for dialogue. "If the tribes are indeed facing plague as well as winter hardship, it might explain the war chief's unexpected peace overture."

Claudius's eyes widened slightly as he grasped the implications. "A shared threat creating opportunity for communication rather than conflict."

"Possibly," Titus agreed. "Though it could equally be a tactical move to gain time or intelligence while their forces continue to gather."

"Or both," the physician suggested. "Human motivations are rarely simple, especially in crisis. The tribes may simultaneously prepare for war while seeking alternatives to it, particularly if disease threatens their people."

This aligned with Titus's own assessment. In his experience, frontier conflicts were rarely as straightforward as Rome's Senate or distant military planners imagined. The line between enemy and potential ally often blurred, particularly when facing common threats like harsh winter conditions or, potentially, epidemic disease.

"I've decided to meet with Arminius as requested," Titus informed Claudius. "Three days from now, at the frozen river bend. The Emperor has granted discretion in this matter, and I see potential value in direct communication."

"A significant risk," Claudius observed, "especially with disease potentially spreading from their territories."

"Which is why you'll accompany the meeting party," Titus replied. "Your medical expertise may prove as valuable as military or diplomatic skills in this situation."

Claudius looked surprised but nodded his acceptance. "What do you hope to achieve?"

"Information, primarily. Better understanding of tribal movements and intentions. Confirmation of whether disease drives their actions. And possibly—though I consider this less likely—some arrangement that reduces immediate conflict risk while we address the plague threat."

"And if Arminius himself carries contagion? Or if the meeting is merely a trap?"

"Hence the risk," Titus acknowledged. "But calculated rather than reckless. We'll take precautions on both fronts."

Their discussion was interrupted by another knock—more urgent this time. Decimus entered without waiting for response, his expression tense.

"Prefect, scouts report movement on the northern bank. Multiple signal fires visible along the treeline. And the river ice has solidified further—it may be crossable in several sections now."

Titus straightened, immediately alert. "Prepare the watch rotation for potential night action. Double the sentries along the wall. And have Valerius report to me immediately—I need his assessment of what these signals might mean."

As Decimus departed to implement these orders, Titus turned back to Claudius. "It seems our timelines may be compressing. Implement your medical protocols with all possible speed, but understand that military necessities may force compromises."

"Disease recognizes no such compromises," Claudius reminded him soberly. "It strikes regardless of our preferences or plans."

"As do tribal forces, if they choose to cross the frozen river," Titus countered. "We must address both threats simultaneously, not sequentially."

The physician nodded reluctantly, accepting the reality of their situation. "I'll begin immediately. But Prefect—the meeting with Arminius may now be our best hope for avoiding the worst outcomes on both fronts."

"A sentiment with which the Emperor would likely agree," Titus said, thinking of Marcus Aurelius's philosophical approach to governance and conflict. "Though hope must be balanced with practical preparation for less favorable outcomes."

After Claudius departed, Titus returned to the window, gazing northward though darkness had now fallen completely. Beyond the torchlit walls of Carnuntum, beyond the frozen river, signal fires flickered along the distant treeline—communication whose meaning remained unclear but whose timing could hardly be coincidental.

The frontier situation had always been complex. Now it had become even more so, with disease, diplomacy, and potential conflict intertwining in ways that defied simple military response. The coming days would test not just the legion's fighting capacity but its adaptability to unexpected challenges—challenges that crossed boundaries between Roman and barbarian, between military and medical, between conflict and potential cooperation.

Titus Aelius Gallus had defended this section of frontier for fifteen years, through raids and truces, through summer campaigns and winter hardships. But he had never faced a situation quite like this—one where the greatest threat might come not from enemy weapons but from microscopic contagion that recognized no allegiance and respected no boundary, not even the mighty Danube itself.

As he turned from the window to prepare for Valerius's arrival, Titus felt the weight of command more heavily than usual. Decisions made in the coming days would determine not just military outcomes but the very survival of many under his protection—both those who wore the eagle of Rome and, potentially, those beyond the river who might otherwise be enemies but now faced a common threat.

The bronze bear pendant that Arminius had sent lay on his desk, a tangible reminder of unexpected connections across seemingly rigid boundaries. Whether those connections would lead to reduced bloodshed or merely more complex conflict remained to be seen. But the possibility itself represented something rare and valuable on this harsh frontier—an opening, however small, for alternatives to the endless cycle of raid and reprisal that had defined Roman-tribal relations for generations.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new information, new decisions required. For tonight, Titus would prepare as best he could, balancing military readiness against medical necessity, immediate tactical concerns against longer-term strategic implications. The path forward was unclear, but the stakes—for the legion, for the frontier, and perhaps for the empire itself—could not be higher.
