# Chapter 7: The Healers

Two tribal women arrived at Carnuntum's north gate at dawn, just as Arminius had promised. They stood in the bitter cold, breath clouding the still air, waiting as sentries verified their identity. The elder wore silver-streaked hair braided beneath a fur hood; the younger—perhaps thirty—watched everything with the keen eyes of someone accustomed to spotting subtle symptoms in the sick.

They carried simple packs of medicines and implements but no weapons—not even the small knives tribal people typically carried for everyday tasks. "Arminius was clear," they explained through Valerius, summoned to translate. "Nothing should hinder our mission to share healing knowledge with your physicians."

Claudius Galenus waited in a small building beside the main infirmary—a space hastily converted from storage for this unprecedented exchange. A table, benches, and a small brazier that pushed back the winter chill filled the modest room.

"Welcome to Carnuntum," Claudius greeted them in Latin as they entered, Valerius translating. "I am Claudius Galenus, chief physician of this garrison. We appreciate your willingness to share knowledge that may save lives on both sides of the river."

The elder woman nodded, her face revealing neither warmth nor hostility—just the professional assessment of one healer meeting another. "I am Hulda of the Bear Clan," she replied through Valerius. "This is my apprentice, Frieda. We bring methods born from our people's suffering, hoping shared knowledge might thin death's harvest among both our peoples."

They moved to the table where Claudius had arranged his medical implements—bronze and iron surgical tools, ceramic containers of herbal preparations, scrolls of medical texts—all displayed with methodical precision. The arrangement served as both demonstration of Roman medical advancement and practical starting point for comparing plague treatments.

Hulda studied these items with evident interest, recognizing some while showing curiosity about others. She unpacked her own materials—leather pouches of dried herbs and powders, wooden containers of salves and tinctures, bundles of tree bark and fungi, implements carved from bone and antler.

"The sickness follows patterns," she began without preamble. "Fever and weakness first, then it attacks the lungs and spreads purple marks across the skin. Those who survive the seventh day may recover, though many remain weakened for months."

Claudius nodded, recognizing the same progression. "Our experience matches yours. The disease spreads before symptoms appear, making isolation of visible cases insufficient. We've found no reliable cure, though certain treatments seem to reduce suffering."

This honest admission of Roman medicine's limits seemed to establish trust. Hulda's eyes softened slightly, perhaps having expected more arrogance.

"We too have found no certain cure," she admitted. "But through many deaths and careful watching, we've developed methods that seem to increase survival chances, especially for those not already weakened by age or previous illness."

What followed was a detailed exchange unlike any in Claudius's extensive career. Hulda described treatments developed through generations of tribal healing tradition—teas brewed from specific herb and fungi combinations, poultices for easing breathing, methods of reducing fever through controlled cold exposure followed by gradual warming.

Most intriguing was a preparation from a particular fungus growing on birch trees in northern forests. When properly prepared and administered early, Hulda claimed it significantly reduced lung involvement—the aspect of plague that most often killed.

"We gather it only from living trees during the waning moon," she explained, showing a sample of dried fungus. "It must dry slowly near smoke but not in direct heat, then be ground and steeped in hot water for precisely the time it takes to recite the healing prayer three times."

Claudius noted these details carefully. While the prayer element reflected tribal spirituality, the specific preparation method likely preserved active medicinal properties. Throughout his career, he'd observed that effective traditional remedies often contained genuine pharmacological value, even when wrapped in ritual.

"How is it administered?" he asked, examining the sample.

"The patient drinks the strained liquid three times daily, from first fever until the purple marks fade or death comes," Hulda replied. "It tastes bitter and causes some to vomit the first dose. They must take it again immediately if this happens."

Claudius nodded, making notes on a wax tablet. Practical administration details were as crucial as preparation method—dosage, timing, and managing side effects all critical to effective treatment.

In exchange, he shared his own approaches—cooling methods for fever, herbal preparations for respiratory distress, hydration protocols developed during the previous outbreak. He explained the camp's containment measures, the separation of the garrison into smaller units with minimal cross-contact, the enhanced sanitation throughout all quarters.

Hulda listened attentively, occasionally asking questions that revealed sophisticated understanding of disease progression. Her apprentice remained largely silent but observed everything, sometimes making notes using symbols scratched onto smooth bark.

As morning progressed, their exchange deepened from specific treatments to underlying principles of healing. Despite vastly different cultural frameworks, Claudius found they shared fundamental approaches—careful observation, pattern recognition, methodical testing, and adaptation based on results.

"Your people believe the sickness comes from bad air or imbalanced humors," Hulda observed, showing awareness of Roman medical theory. "We believe spirits carry it into the body through breath. Different explanations, yet we both cover our faces when treating the sick, we both isolate them from the healthy, we both know proximity increases risk."

"Different paths to the same practical wisdom," Claudius acknowledged. "Though I suspect neither explanation fully captures the disease's true nature."

Their philosophical exchange broke when Demetrius arrived with news of a new case—a young legionary showing early fever and respiratory distress, now isolated in the infirmary.

"An opportunity to demonstrate our methods in practice," Hulda suggested, gathering several preparations. "If you permit."

Claudius hesitated briefly before nodding. While allowing a tribal healer to treat a Roman soldier was unprecedented, potential benefit outweighed convention—especially given poor outcomes with standard treatments.

They moved to the infirmary, where the new patient lay on a pallet in isolation, face flushed with fever but not yet showing the purple spots of later stages. A young man, perhaps twenty, with a legionary's muscular build now weakened by disease.

Hulda approached confidently, her manner shifting from theoretical discussion to practical healing. She examined him with experienced hands—checking pulse at neck and wrist, placing her ear against his chest to listen to breathing, examining eyes and tongue.

"Early stages," she confirmed. "The lung involvement has begun but remains limited. A good candidate for the birch fungus treatment."

With Claudius's permission, she prepared the remedy, demonstrating the precise method of measuring, steeping, and straining. The resulting liquid was dark and bitter-smelling, making the patient grimace when it reached his lips.

"He must drink it all," Hulda instructed. "And again at midday and sunset. For seven days or until the fever breaks completely."

The young legionary looked to Claudius, understandably hesitant to consume medicine prepared by a tribal healer. At the physician's nod, he drank the bitter liquid, managing to keep it down despite evident distaste.

Hulda then demonstrated other elements of her approach—a poultice of specific herbs applied to the chest, a method of controlled cooling using cloths soaked in mint-infused water, precise positioning to facilitate lung drainage.

Throughout, she explained each step to Claudius and his assistants, ensuring the knowledge could be replicated after her departure. The practical demonstration added crucial details that theoretical discussion alone might miss—the exact consistency of preparations, the specific placement of poultices, the timing of interventions.

"These methods won't save all," she cautioned as they finished. "The very young, the elderly, those already weakened—many will still die despite our best efforts. But for those with strength to fight, these approaches may tip the balance toward survival."

Claudius nodded, understanding both the potential and limitations of what he'd learned. No medical intervention was perfect against a disease as virulent as plague. But even modest improvements in survival rates would save many lives given the outbreak's scale.

They returned to the exchange building, where discussion continued through midday and into afternoon. Claudius shared observations from the previous plague outbreak—spread patterns, symptom variations among different populations, long-term effects in survivors. Hulda described how the disease had moved through tribal territories, forcing abandonment of contaminated villages and contributing to the population movements Roman scouts had observed.

"The sickness recognizes no boundaries between our peoples," she noted as their exchange neared its end. "Perhaps in fighting it together, we find common ground that war would destroy."

It was a philosophical observation that Claudius found himself appreciating, despite his usual focus on practical matters. The plague created a shared enemy that transcended traditional hostilities—an invisible foe killing indiscriminately on both sides of the frontier.

As evening approached, Hulda and Frieda prepared to leave, having fulfilled their mission. They left substantial quantities of their medicinal preparations, including the precious birch fungus, with detailed instructions. In exchange, Claudius provided several of his own remedies that had shown promise, along with a small surgical kit Hulda had admired.

"We'll return in seven days to check the patient and bring more fungus preparation," Hulda said as they gathered their belongings. "By then, you'll have seen whether our methods work in Roman bodies as they have among our people."

Claudius walked them to the north gate, where an escort waited to guide them safely back to the river crossing. The brief winter day was already fading, temperature dropping sharply as shadows lengthened across the snow.

"Your knowledge may save many lives on both sides of the river," he told Hulda. "That creates a debt that transcends the usual relations between our peoples."

The tribal healer considered this thoughtfully. "Knowledge freely shared creates no debt," she replied. "It honors our ancestors, who understood that healing belongs to no single tribe or nation. The plants and fungi offer their medicine to all who learn their secrets, not only to those who claim certain territories."

With that perspective—one Claudius found surprisingly aligned with his own views on medical knowledge—the tribal healers departed, their figures gradually disappearing into the gathering dusk as they made their way toward the frozen Danube.

Claudius returned to the infirmary, his mind already organizing the new information. The exchange had exceeded his expectations, providing not merely specific remedies but insights into different approaches to understanding and treating disease.

He checked on the young legionary who had received Hulda's treatment, finding him resting more comfortably than most plague patients at a similar stage. The fever remained but seemed less intense, and breathing difficulties hadn't progressed as rapidly as typically observed. Whether this represented the treatment's effectiveness or merely variation in the disease's natural course remained to be seen, but it offered hope.

As he continued his evening rounds, Claudius reflected on the day's unusual events. The exchange represented something rare in frontier relations—cooperation based on shared humanity rather than political or military necessity. While Titus and Arminius negotiated the complex diplomatic and strategic dimensions of the frontier situation, he and Hulda had found immediate common ground in their commitment to healing regardless of which side of the river their patients called home.

There was a lesson in this, though Claudius typically concerned himself more with practical medicine than philosophy. The boundaries humans created—between territories, peoples, systems of knowledge—often impeded understanding that might benefit all. Disease recognized no such boundaries, spreading wherever conditions allowed. Perhaps healing should follow the same principle, moving freely across the artificial divisions separating people who shared the same fundamental vulnerabilities.

Titus's arrival interrupted these thoughts. The prefect looked tired but focused, the weight of command evident in his bearing despite efforts to maintain an appearance of unwavering strength.

"The meeting was productive?" he asked without preamble.

"Remarkably so," Claudius confirmed. "Their plague knowledge is sophisticated and practical, developed through extensive experience. Several approaches seem promising, particularly a preparation from a specific forest fungus that appears to reduce lung involvement."

"You've implemented these treatments already?"

"For one patient thus far, recently admitted with early symptoms. The tribal healer demonstrated her methods directly, ensuring we understood the precise preparation and administration. Too soon to determine effectiveness, but initial signs are encouraging."

Titus nodded, satisfied. "And your impression of the healers themselves?"

"Professional, knowledgeable, and surprisingly open to exchanging information rather than merely providing it," Claudius replied. "The elder, Hulda, has clearly spent decades developing her practice. Her understanding of disease progression and treatment principles would be respected even among trained physicians in Rome."

This evaluation seemed to please Titus, confirming his decision to accept Arminius's offer of medical exchange. "They'll return?"

"In seven days, to check the patient's progress and bring additional preparations. They've left sufficient quantities for immediate needs, with detailed instructions."

"Good." Titus glanced toward the isolation section. "Any change in the overall outbreak?"

"Containment measures continue working," Claudius reported. "No new cases in three days except the young legionary treated today. Those already infected follow the expected progression—some improving, others deteriorating despite our efforts."

He hesitated before adding, "If the tribal remedies prove effective, particularly the fungus preparation, we may see improved recovery rates. But implementation will require gathering or obtaining significant quantities of materials that grow primarily in northern forests."

"Another potential area for cooperation," Titus noted. "Medicinal supplies exchanged or traded rather than merely knowledge."

"Precisely. Though such arrangements would require broader authorization than our current limited exchange."

Titus nodded understanding. The medical cooperation, like the diplomatic engagement with Arminius, represented a departure from traditional frontier relations that would require imperial approval for any significant expansion.

"Document everything thoroughly," he instructed. "Both the specific treatments and your assessment of their effectiveness. I'll include this information in my dispatch to the Emperor regarding the broader frontier situation."

After Titus left, Claudius returned to the small building where the knowledge exchange had taken place. The table still held samples of both Roman and tribal medicines, physical representations of the different healing traditions shared that day.

He began the detailed documentation Titus had requested, recording not only specific remedies and their preparation but the underlying principles Hulda had explained. This information would be valuable not merely for the current outbreak but for future occurrences of the plague, which history suggested would eventually return despite all preventive efforts.

As he worked, Claudius appreciated the unexpected opportunity that had emerged from the frontier crisis. Throughout his career, he had sought medical knowledge wherever it might be found—studying with physicians from Greece, Egypt, and Syria, examining healing practices from diverse cultures throughout the empire. Yet he had never anticipated learning valuable approaches from tribal healers beyond the northern frontier, people typically dismissed by Romans as primitive and superstitious.

The experience reinforced a principle he had long believed but sometimes forgotten in the structured environment of Roman medicine—that effective healing knowledge could develop in any culture that observed carefully and tested methodically, regardless of technological advancement or philosophical framework. The tribal healers lacked the extensive written tradition and theoretical structures of Roman medicine, but their practical experience with the plague had led them to effective approaches that imperial physicians had not discovered despite more formal training.

There was humility in this realization, a reminder that no single medical tradition—not even one as advanced as Rome's—held all answers to the complex challenges of disease. Progress came through exchange and integration, through willingness to learn from different approaches rather than dismissing them based on origin.

Claudius completed his documentation late into the night, creating a comprehensive record of what he had learned. Tomorrow he would begin implementing their methods more broadly among the plague patients, carefully observing and recording outcomes to determine which approaches proved most effective.

The exchange represented a small point of light in the otherwise dark situation of plague and potential conflict—a reminder that cooperation remained possible even between peoples typically separated by hostility and misunderstanding. Whether this cooperation would extend beyond medical matters to the broader diplomatic and strategic questions facing the frontier remained to be seen. But for Claudius, focused on saving lives regardless of which side of the river they called home, today's exchange offered both practical hope and philosophical reassurance that common ground could be found when fundamental human needs transcended political divisions.

---

The following days brought cautious optimism regarding both the medical exchange and the broader frontier situation. The young legionary who had received Hulda's treatment showed remarkable improvement—fever breaking on the fourth day, respiratory symptoms steadily diminishing, the dreaded purple spots appearing only minimally before fading.

Encouraged by this outcome, Claudius implemented the tribal remedies for other plague patients, carefully following Hulda's instructions. Results varied, as expected—some patients showing similar improvement, others progressing to more severe stages despite treatment. But overall, the survival rate improved compared to previous patterns, particularly among younger, stronger patients treated early.

The birch fungus preparation proved especially valuable, its effect on reducing lung involvement noticeable in multiple cases. Claudius began training his assistants to recognize the specific fungus from samples Hulda had provided, though gathering new supplies would require either cooperation with the tribes or expeditions into the northern forests once weather permitted.

Beyond the infirmary, the diplomatic process initiated by the meeting between Titus and Arminius continued to develop. Imperial couriers traveled between Carnuntum and Sirmium despite winter conditions, carrying detailed reports and directives as Marcus Aurelius considered the unprecedented proposal for temporary tribal settlement south of the river.

Titus maintained regular communication with Arminius through messengers exchanged at the river crossing, each side providing updates on their respective situations while the imperial decision remained pending. The tribal leader reported continuing pressure from northern populations but confirmed that the gathered forces remained under control, with no unauthorized movements toward the frontier.

Within Carnuntum, the plague containment measures remained in effect, though modified slightly based on improved understanding of the disease's transmission. The camp continued to function at reduced but adequate efficiency, maintaining essential operations while limiting potential spread between units.

Seven days after their initial visit, Hulda and Frieda returned as promised, arriving at dawn at the north gate. This time the sentries received them with noticeably less suspicion, their status as healers now recognized and respected throughout the camp following the positive outcomes of their previous visit.

Claudius welcomed them warmly, eager to share the results of implementing their treatments and to discuss refinements based on observations of specific cases. They proceeded directly to the infirmary, where the young legionary who had first received the tribal remedies now sat up on his pallet, still weakened but clearly recovering—a dramatic contrast to the typical progression of plague cases at a similar stage.

"The fungus medicine has worked well in this one," Hulda observed with professional satisfaction rather than surprise. "His life-force was strong to begin with, and the treatment began before the sickness took deep root in his lungs."

She examined him thoroughly, checking pulse and breathing, examining the fading spots on his skin, testing his strength with simple movement exercises. Frieda observed carefully, occasionally making notes on her bark tablet using their symbolic writing system.

"He will recover fully," Hulda concluded. "Though strength will return slowly, over many weeks. The sickness leaves shadows in the body even after its visible signs have disappeared."

This aligned with Claudius's own observations of plague survivors from the previous outbreak—many experiencing lingering weakness, breathing difficulties, or other symptoms for months after apparent recovery. He had documented these long-term effects extensively, noting patterns that might help identify which patients required continued care beyond the acute phase.

They proceeded to examine other patients who had received the tribal treatments, Hulda offering adjustments to dosages or application methods based on individual responses. For some, she recommended increased quantities of the fungus preparation; for others, different combinations of the herbal poultices used to ease breathing difficulties.

The morning passed in this detailed clinical work, healer and physician collaborating as if they had practiced together for years rather than days. Their different backgrounds and training approaches seemed to complement rather than conflict, each bringing unique perspectives to the challenging work of treating a disease that had defied conventional approaches on both sides of the frontier.

"Your people have implemented our methods well," Hulda commented as they completed their rounds. "Better than I expected, given how differently we understand the body and its workings."

"The principles of careful observation and methodical treatment transcend different explanatory frameworks," Claudius replied. "And the results speak for themselves—more patients surviving, fewer progressing to the most severe stages."

They returned to the exchange building, where Claudius had prepared a meal—simple frontier fare, but offered with genuine hospitality. As they ate, the conversation shifted from immediate medical concerns to broader implications of their collaboration.

"Arminius believes this medical exchange may help build trust for the larger negotiations," Hulda observed. "Showing that cooperation benefits both sides, even in small ways."

Claudius nodded, recognizing the political dimensions that inevitably shaped even this ostensibly humanitarian interaction. "Has the sickness affected your people's ability to maintain normal activities? Hunting, gathering, defense?"

"Severely," Hulda confirmed. "Many of our strongest hunters and warriors have fallen ill. Some died, others remain weakened months later. Combined with the failed harvest and early winter..." She gestured expressively, the implications clear without further elaboration.

This information added context to the tribal movements that Roman scouts had observed—not merely strategic repositioning but a population facing multiple survival threats simultaneously. The plague had struck the tribes first, weakening them before reaching Roman territories, and now both sides faced the same invisible enemy while navigating their complex political relationship.

"We've brought more of the fungus preparation," Frieda spoke up, indicating several leather pouches she had placed on the table. "And seeds from the plants used in the breathing poultice. These can be grown in protected areas even during winter, if tended carefully."

This unexpected gift represented significant value—not merely immediate treatment supplies but the means to establish ongoing production of critical medicines. It suggested a level of commitment to the medical collaboration that went beyond the initial agreement, perhaps reflecting Hulda's professional dedication to healing regardless of political boundaries.

"This generosity is appreciated and will be reciprocated," Claudius assured them. "I've prepared several surgical instruments that you admired during your previous visit, along with detailed instructions for their use and care."

The exchange of gifts—practical items of medical value rather than symbolic tokens—reinforced the professional relationship that had developed between the healers from different worlds. Each recognized the other's expertise and commitment to their shared calling, creating a foundation of respect that transcended the traditional hostility between their peoples.

As midday approached, Hulda and Frieda prepared to depart, having completed their clinical assessment and exchange of supplies. They would return again in seven days, continuing the pattern of regular consultation that both sides now valued.

"There is something else," Hulda said as they gathered their belongings. "A matter I was instructed to mention only if I judged the collaboration to be genuine and productive."

Claudius raised an eyebrow, waiting for her to continue.

"There is a place three days' journey north of the river," she explained. "A cave beside a hot spring, where the waters carry minerals that seem to speed recovery from the sickness. We have taken our most important people there when they fall ill—those whose knowledge or leadership we cannot afford to lose."

This was significant new information—a treatment resource unknown to Roman medicine, potentially valuable for critical cases. But the location beyond the frontier made it inaccessible under normal circumstances.

"Arminius has authorized me to extend an invitation," Hulda continued. "If you have patients of particular importance whose recovery seems doubtful with standard treatments, arrangements could be made for them to be treated at the healing springs. Under truce conditions, with appropriate escorts from both sides."

The offer was unprecedented—tribal healers not merely sharing knowledge but proposing to treat Roman patients in their own sacred healing place. It represented either extraordinary goodwill or a calculated political gesture designed to build trust for the broader negotiations. Perhaps both simultaneously.

"I will convey this offer to Prefect Gallus," Claudius replied carefully. "The decision would require his authorization, as it involves movement of personnel beyond our defensive perimeter."

Hulda nodded, understanding the chain of command that governed Roman operations. "The offer remains open while the truce holds. The healing springs have saved many who would have died otherwise, though we cannot explain precisely how the waters work their effects."

After the tribal healers had departed, Claudius sought out Titus to report on both the medical progress and the unexpected invitation to the healing springs. He found the prefect in the principia, reviewing dispatches that had arrived from Sirmium during the morning.

"The Emperor has responded to our initial report regarding Arminius's proposal," Titus informed him before Claudius could speak. "He authorizes continued negotiation while reinforcements are positioned at key points along the frontier. A balanced approach—neither rejecting the possibility of an unconventional arrangement nor committing to it before additional security measures are in place."

This measured response was characteristic of Marcus Aurelius—thoughtful consideration of innovative approaches while maintaining practical precautions. It suggested the Emperor was taking Arminius's proposal seriously rather than dismissing it as merely a delaying tactic or deception.

"The medical exchange continues to show promise," Claudius reported, explaining the improved outcomes among patients receiving the tribal treatments. "The young legionary who received the first treatment is recovering well, and several others show similar positive responses. The tribal healers have provided additional supplies and seeds for growing certain medicinal plants within the camp."

Titus nodded, pleased with this development. "Include detailed documentation in the next dispatch to Sirmium. The Emperor specifically requested medical information, noting that Galen has expressed interest in the tribal treatments based on our preliminary report."

The mention of Galen—the Emperor's personal physician and the most renowned medical authority in the empire—indicated the seriousness with which the medical exchange was being viewed at the highest levels. What had begun as a practical local arrangement might have implications for plague treatment throughout Roman territories.

"There is another matter," Claudius continued, explaining Hulda's invitation regarding the healing springs. "It represents either genuine humanitarian cooperation or a calculated gesture to build trust for the broader negotiations. Perhaps both simultaneously."

Titus considered this thoughtfully. "Who would you recommend for such treatment, if authorization were granted?"

"The centurion Flavius shows the most severe symptoms among our current patients," Claudius replied. "His knowledge of the eastern frontier defenses makes him particularly valuable, yet his condition continues to deteriorate despite our best efforts. He might benefit from this alternative approach, if the tribal healers' claims regarding the springs are accurate."

The prefect nodded, weighing the potential benefits against the obvious risks of sending a senior officer beyond the frontier under these uncertain conditions. "Prepare a detailed assessment of his condition and prognosis with current treatments versus the potential benefits of this alternative. I'll consider authorization if you believe the medical justification is sufficient."

This cautious but not dismissive response reflected Titus's balanced approach to the complex frontier situation—willing to consider unconventional options when circumstances warranted, yet careful to evaluate risks thoroughly before committing to unprecedented actions.

As Claudius returned to the infirmary to continue implementing the tribal treatments among the plague patients, he reflected on how rapidly the situation had evolved. What had begun as a desperate frontier crisis—plague within the camp, tribal forces gathering beyond the river, winter conditions limiting both military options and supply lines—had unexpectedly opened possibilities for cooperation that would have seemed unimaginable just weeks earlier.

Whether this cooperation would extend beyond immediate medical necessity to the broader questions of frontier relations remained uncertain. But the exchange between healers had already demonstrated that common ground could be found when fundamental human needs transcended political boundaries—a small but significant point of light in the darkness of plague and potential conflict that had settled over the frozen frontier.
