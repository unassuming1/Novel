# Chapter 4: The Physician's Burden

Claudius Galenus moved through the infirmary with practiced efficiency, checking each patient with careful attention. The large tent that served as Carnuntum's medical facility had been expanded twice in recent weeks as winter illnesses spread through the camp. What had begun as a space for twenty patients now accommodated nearly fifty, with more arriving daily.

"The fever has broken," he noted, placing a hand on the forehead of a young legionary who had been delirious the previous evening. "Continue the willow bark infusion every four hours, and begin broth if he wakes lucid."

The medical orderly—a former gladiator named Demetrius whose fighting career had ended with a crippled leg—nodded and made a notation on the wax tablet he carried. Despite his fearsome appearance, with a face scarred from years in the arena, Demetrius had proven to have a gentle touch with patients and a remarkable memory for treatment details.

"The scout brought in from the river crossing?" Claudius asked, moving to the next pallet.

"Improving, physician," Demetrius replied. "Lungs remain clear, no fever. He woke twice during the night, took water and a little broth."

Claudius nodded with satisfaction. Immersion in the Danube's frigid winter waters was often fatal, either from immediate cold shock or subsequent lung inflammation. That Flavius had avoided both was testament to both his youth and the prompt treatment he had received.

The physician continued his rounds, addressing each case according to its needs—adjusting bandages on a soldier whose hand had been crushed during fortification work, examining the healing progress of a centurion's sword wound from a training accident, checking the rash that had spread across a cavalry officer's chest and back. Each patient received the same careful attention, regardless of rank or condition.

As he worked, Claudius's mind categorized and analyzed the patterns of illness he observed. The respiratory ailments were typical of winter campaigns—cold, dampness, and crowded conditions creating ideal circumstances for contagion. The injuries reflected the increased pace of preparation—men working too quickly or with insufficient rest, leading to accidents that would have been avoided in less urgent times.

But there were other cases that concerned him more deeply. Three soldiers had been admitted in the past week with symptoms that reminded him uncomfortably of the plague that had swept through the empire years earlier—high fever, skin discoloration, bloody sputum. Two had died despite his best efforts; the third remained in an isolated section of the infirmary, his condition deteriorating despite all treatments.

"The man from the Tenth Century?" Claudius asked quietly as he and Demetrius reached the screened-off area at the rear of the tent.

Demetrius's expression was grave. "No change since midnight. The fever remains high, breathing more labored. The spots have spread across his chest and face."

Claudius steeled himself before stepping behind the screen. Despite years of medical practice in conditions ranging from the gladiatorial schools of Pergamon to the battlefields of the eastern campaigns, cases like this still affected him deeply—not merely as professional challenges but as human suffering he could do little to alleviate.

The patient lay on a pallet slightly separated from the main infirmary area. A young man, perhaps twenty-five, with the muscular build of a career soldier. His face, normally olive-complexioned, was now flushed with fever except where dark purple spots had formed on his cheeks and forehead. His breathing came in labored gasps, each inhalation a visible struggle.

Claudius checked the pulse at the soldier's neck—rapid and weak. The skin burned with fever despite the cooling compresses that had been applied. When he gently pulled back an eyelid, the sclera showed yellow discoloration.

"Has he been conscious at all?" Claudius asked.

"Briefly, near dawn," Demetrius replied. "Disoriented, calling for his mother. Took a few sips of water before lapsing back."

Claudius nodded grimly. The progression matched what he had observed in the previous cases—and in too many patients during the height of the plague years. The disease followed a predictable course: initial fever and malaise, followed by respiratory difficulty, skin eruptions, and eventually, in most cases, death from what appeared to be a combination of fluid in the lungs and general systemic collapse.

"Continue the cooling measures," he instructed. "The fever extract every two hours if he can swallow. If not, soak cloths in the solution and place them under his tongue. And Demetrius—"

"Yes, physician?"

"Full precautions for yourself and anyone else who attends him. Vinegar washing before and after contact, separate utensils, masks soaked in the cedar infusion."

The orderly nodded, understanding the implications. These were the protocols they had developed during the plague years—measures that seemed to reduce, though not eliminate, the risk of contagion among medical personnel.

"Should I inform the prefect?" Demetrius asked quietly.

Claudius considered the question carefully. Three cases did not necessarily indicate a new outbreak of the plague. Similar symptoms could result from other diseases, particularly in winter conditions. Creating alarm prematurely could damage morale at a critical time.

Yet if it was the plague returning, early action might contain its spread. The lessons of the previous outbreak had been learned at terrible cost—delay in recognition and response had allowed the disease to establish itself throughout the legions before effective measures were implemented.

"Not yet," Claudius decided. "I want to examine the patient's quarters and speak with his tent mates first. If there are additional cases developing or clear evidence of contagion patterns, then we'll bring it to Prefect Gallus's attention."

After completing his rounds, Claudius returned to his own quarters—a small but private space attached to the infirmary. Unlike many physicians who traveled with minimal equipment, relying on locally available materials, Claudius maintained an extensive collection of medical instruments, reference scrolls, and pharmaceutical supplies. His position as personal physician to the Emperor granted him resources that most military doctors could only dream of.

He washed thoroughly with vinegar solution, changed his tunic, and sat at the small desk where he maintained his medical journals. Recording observations was, to Claudius, as essential to the practice of medicine as diagnosis or treatment. Only through systematic documentation could patterns be identified, treatments evaluated, and knowledge advanced.

He unrolled a fresh sheet of parchment and began noting the details of the three suspicious cases—age, previous health status, assignment within the legion, onset and progression of symptoms, treatments attempted and their effects. As the information took shape on the page, he searched for commonalities that might suggest a source or pattern of transmission.

All three men had been from different centuries, with different duties and living arrangements. They had not, as far as he could determine, shared meals or training sessions in the days before falling ill. The only connection he could identify was that all three had been part of a patrol along the river five days before the first man reported to the infirmary.

This was potentially significant. If the disease had crossed the Danube with the tribes, it might explain some of the unusual movements Valerius and the other scouts had reported. Communities fleeing from contagion would behave differently than those preparing for war, though the two were not mutually exclusive.

A discreet knock at his door interrupted these reflections. "Enter," he called, setting aside his notes.

The visitor was Titus Aelius Gallus himself, still wearing the light armor he favored for daily duties around the camp. The prefect looked tired, with shadows under his eyes suggesting another night of insufficient sleep.

"Physician," Titus greeted him with a respectful nod. "I hope I'm not interrupting important work."

"Nothing that cannot wait," Claudius replied, rising to offer his visitor the room's only comfortable chair. "Though I suspect you haven't come merely for conversation."

A faint smile crossed Titus's face. "Perceptive as always. No, I have questions of a medical nature—both personal and regarding the camp's health."

Claudius gestured for the prefect to continue, his expression attentive. As a physician, he was accustomed to being consulted on matters ranging from individual ailments to broader health concerns affecting entire communities.

"The personal matter first," Titus said, his voice dropping slightly though there was no one else to hear. "The headaches have returned, worse than before. Three in the past week, each lasting hours. Light sensitivity, nausea, difficulty focusing on reports."

Claudius nodded, unsurprised. Titus had suffered from severe headaches periodically for years, a condition that had worsened during times of particular stress or after periods of inadequate rest. The current frontier situation provided ample cause for both.

"You've been using the feverfew preparation?" he asked.

"When possible," Titus confirmed. "It helps somewhat if taken at the first signs. But lately, the onset is more sudden, with little warning before full intensity."

"And sleep?"

A dismissive gesture. "What the situation allows."

"Which is clearly insufficient," Claudius observed dryly. "The connection between exhaustion and these headaches has been well-established in your case, Prefect. Medicine can only compensate so much for the body's neglected needs."

Titus accepted the mild rebuke with a nod. Unlike many military commanders who viewed physical limitations as weaknesses to be overcome through sheer will, he had learned to respect the physician's counsel, even when circumstances made it difficult to follow.

"I'll prepare a stronger preparation," Claudius decided. "To be taken at the first sign of symptoms, and a smaller preventive dose each morning. But understand that it treats the manifestation, not the cause. Without adequate rest, the condition will continue to worsen."

"Rest will come when the frontier is secure," Titus replied, the familiar response in their ongoing negotiation over his health. "Now, to the broader concern. What is the general health status of the camp?"

Claudius considered how to frame his response. As a physician, his first loyalty was to truth and the well-being of those under his care. Yet he also understood the military realities that Titus balanced—the need for accurate information without creating undue alarm that might affect morale or readiness.

"The usual winter ailments are present and spreading predictably," he began. "Respiratory infections, digestive complaints from preserved rations, minor injuries from construction and training. Nothing that significantly impacts overall readiness."

He paused, weighing his next words carefully. "There are, however, three cases that bear closer watching. Symptoms reminiscent of the plague—high fever, respiratory distress, characteristic skin eruptions. Two have died; the third is unlikely to survive the day."

Titus's expression remained composed, but Claudius noted the slight tension that appeared around his eyes—the only visible reaction to news that would alarm most commanders.

"You believe it's the same disease?" Titus asked quietly.

"I cannot be certain," Claudius admitted. "Similar symptoms can arise from different causes. But the progression and presentation are... concerning in their familiarity."

"Containment measures?"

"Already implemented for these cases. Isolation, separate attendants with protective protocols, thorough cleansing of their quarters and effects." Claudius leaned forward slightly. "But if this is indeed the plague returning, these measures may prove insufficient. The disease spreads before symptoms become apparent, making isolation of only visible cases inadequate."

Titus absorbed this information silently, his mind clearly working through the strategic implications. The plague had devastated the legions during its previous appearance, reducing some units to half strength through death and incapacitation. A new outbreak, combined with the gathering tribal threat beyond the river, would create a potentially catastrophic situation.

"Your recommendation?" he finally asked.

"Heightened vigilance throughout the camp," Claudius replied promptly. "Daily health inspections of all centuries. Immediate isolation of anyone showing initial symptoms—fever, unusual fatigue, respiratory complaints. Increased sanitation measures, particularly in communal areas like the baths and mess."

"And if more cases appear?"

"Then more significant measures become necessary," Claudius said gravely. "Separation of the camp into smaller units with minimal cross-contact. Rotation of duties to limit exposure patterns. Possibly even temporary suspension of patrols and training activities that bring large groups together."

Titus nodded slowly, accepting the medical logic while clearly considering how such measures would affect military readiness. "Implement the heightened vigilance and sanitation immediately," he decided. "Prepare contingency plans for the more restrictive measures, but hold them in reserve pending further developments."

"And the Emperor?" Claudius asked. "Should he be informed?"

This was a delicate question. As imperial physician, Claudius maintained a direct correspondence with Marcus Aurelius regarding health matters throughout the frontier forces. Yet he respected the military chain of command and would not circumvent Titus's authority in his own camp.

"Include it in your regular health report," Titus decided after brief consideration. "Factual, without speculation beyond what the evidence supports. The Emperor appreciates clarity, not alarmism."

Claudius nodded agreement. It was a reasonable approach—acknowledging the potential concern without elevating it beyond current evidence. If additional cases appeared or the pattern of spread became clearer, they could update the Emperor accordingly.

As Titus rose to leave, Claudius noted again the signs of fatigue in his bearing—the slight stiffness in movement, the momentary delay in focusing when he turned toward the door. The prefect was driving himself relentlessly, as were many of the officers under the pressure of the frontier situation. Such exhaustion inevitably affected judgment and decision-making, creating risks beyond the physical health concerns.

"Prefect," Claudius said, his tone shifting subtly from physician to friend. "The camp follows your example, in health practices as in all else. If you dismiss your own needs for rest and recovery, others will do the same—with consequences for overall readiness that no medicine can address."

Titus paused at the door, a faint smile acknowledging the point. "Noted, physician. I'll consider it part of my duty to the legion."

"See that you do," Claudius replied with matching dryness. "I have enough patients without adding the entire command staff to my rounds."

After Titus had departed, Claudius returned to his notes, adding the details of their discussion and the measures to be implemented. Then he began preparing the stronger headache remedy he had promised—a mixture of feverfew, willow bark, and several other herbs whose properties he had studied extensively during his years of research.

As he worked, his mind continued analyzing the three suspicious cases. If this was indeed the plague returning, timing could not be worse. The frontier forces were already stretched thin, with reinforcements still en route from Sirmium. An outbreak that further reduced their effective strength would leave the Danube crossing points dangerously vulnerable if the tribal gathering turned to open aggression.

Yet there was another possibility, one that connected to the reports from beyond the river. If the plague had reached the tribal territories, it might explain both their unusual movements and potentially even Arminius's unexpected peace overture. Disease recognized no borders and respected no military alignments. It killed Roman and Germanic alike with equal efficiency.

Could this shared threat form the basis for avoiding unnecessary conflict? It seemed unlikely given the historical enmity between Rome and the tribes. Yet Claudius had seen stranger alliances formed in the face of common dangers.

He completed the medicinal preparation and sealed it in a small ceramic container for delivery to Titus's quarters. Then he returned to the infirmary to check on the critical patient once more, his mind still turning over the complex intersection of medical and military concerns that the frontier situation presented.

The isolated section was quiet when he entered, the only sound the labored breathing of the sick legionary. Demetrius sat nearby, maintaining his vigil despite having been on duty since before dawn.

"Any change?" Claudius asked softly.

The orderly shook his head. "The breathing grows more difficult. He hasn't regained consciousness since I last reported."

Claudius checked the patient again, finding exactly what he had expected—progression of the disease following the pattern he remembered too well from the plague years. The purple spots had spread and darkened. The fever remained dangerously high despite their cooling efforts. The pulse was weaker, more erratic.

"He won't last the night," Claudius concluded quietly. "Continue the comfort measures, but there's little more we can do."

Demetrius nodded, his scarred face impassive but his eyes reflecting the resignation of one who had seen death many times, both in the arena and in the infirmary. "His tent mates?" he asked. "Should they be isolated as a precaution?"

"Yes," Claudius decided. "Separate quarters, limited duty contact with others, daily health checks. No need to alarm them unnecessarily, but prudent observation is warranted."

As he turned to leave, a commotion at the main infirmary entrance caught his attention—voices raised, the sound of multiple people entering with urgency rather than the usual measured pace of scheduled patients or visitors.

Claudius moved quickly through the tent, finding two legionaries supporting a third between them. The man's head hung forward, his legs dragging as his comrades half-carried him toward an empty pallet.

"What happened?" Claudius demanded, immediately assessing the new arrival.

"Collapsed during patrol rotation," one of the legionaries explained, helping ease their burden onto the pallet. "Fever started yesterday, he said. Thought it was just the usual winter chill. Then he couldn't stand during formation."

Claudius bent over the patient, his experienced hands checking vital signs while his eyes noted symptoms—high fever, rapid shallow breathing, and most significantly, the beginning of the characteristic purple spots at the hairline and along the neck.

A fourth case, from yet another century. The pattern was becoming clearer, and with it, the gravity of their situation.

"Demetrius," he called, his voice calm but carrying the authority that had served him from imperial palace to battlefield hospital. "Prepare the isolation protocol for a new patient. And send word to Prefect Gallus immediately. The situation has developed as we feared."

---

The command tent was unusually crowded for the late hour. Titus had summoned his senior officers immediately upon receiving Claudius's message, along with the camp prefect responsible for logistics and quartering. They gathered around the central table, faces grave as they absorbed the physician's report.

"Four confirmed cases, two pending confirmation," Claudius summarized. "All presenting with the characteristic progression of the plague. Three fatalities already, the others unlikely to survive more than a day or two based on previous experience with the disease."

"The pattern of spread?" Titus asked, focused on the practical implications rather than the grim prognosis for the individuals.

"Still being determined," Claudius replied. "The initial three cases shared river patrol duty five days before symptoms appeared. The newer cases have no obvious connection to them or each other, suggesting the disease is already circulating more widely in the camp."

Decimus, standing at Titus's right as always, frowned deeply. "How long before symptoms appear after exposure?"

"Based on previous observations, typically four to six days," Claudius answered. "Though some individuals show symptoms earlier, others later. And critically, people appear to become contagious before showing obvious signs of illness."

This last point caused visible concern among the officers. It meant that by the time a case was identified and isolated, the infected individual had potentially already spread the disease to others for days.

"Worst case scenario?" Titus asked directly.

Claudius didn't soften his assessment. "If this follows the pattern of the previous outbreak, and without extraordinary containment measures, we could see twenty to thirty percent of the camp affected within two weeks. Perhaps half of those would be fatalities, the rest incapacitated for weeks or longer."

The implications were clear to everyone present. Such losses would render the Carnuntum garrison effectively combat-ineffective at precisely the time when maximum strength might be needed to counter the tribal gathering beyond the river.

"The containment measures you mentioned," Titus prompted. "Detail them."

"Immediate isolation of all confirmed and suspected cases," Claudius began. "Daily health inspections of every man in camp, with immediate quarantine of anyone showing even minor symptoms consistent with early stages. Division of the camp into smaller units with minimal cross-contact—essentially creating multiple independent camps within our perimeter."

He continued outlining the measures, each more restrictive than the last—separate mess arrangements, rotation of essential duties to limit exposure patterns, suspension of all non-essential activities that brought large groups together, enhanced sanitation protocols throughout the camp.

"These measures will significantly impact normal operations," the camp prefect observed, stating what was obvious to all present. "Training, construction of additional defenses, patrol rotations—all would be affected."

"Better disrupted than decimated," Decimus replied grimly. "A legion at reduced efficiency is still a legion. A legion ravaged by plague is a liability."

Titus listened to the discussion without immediately weighing in, his mind working through the complex calculus of the situation. Every option carried significant risks. Implementing full containment measures would indeed impact military readiness and might prove an overreaction if the outbreak remained limited. Yet failing to act decisively could allow the disease to establish itself throughout the camp, with potentially catastrophic consequences.

And all this against the backdrop of the gathering threat beyond the river—a threat that might be accelerated if the tribes learned of plague within the Roman camp.

"We will implement the containment measures," he finally decided. "Full protocol as outlined by Physician Claudius, effective immediately. Centurions will be briefed before dawn, implementation to begin with morning muster."

The officers nodded, accepting the decision despite the operational challenges it would create. The plague was a familiar and feared enemy, one they had faced before with devastating results. None wished to repeat that experience.

"There is another dimension to consider," Claudius added, once the immediate decision had been made. "The tribal movements beyond the river may be connected to this development."

This caught everyone's attention. "Explain," Titus prompted.

"The plague doesn't recognize borders," Claudius said. "If it has reached our camp, it may well have appeared in tribal territories as well. The abandoned villages, the unusual population movements, even perhaps this Arminius's unexpected peace overture—all could be responses to disease outbreak among their people."

The officers exchanged glances, considering this perspective. It offered a different interpretation of the intelligence they had gathered, one that complicated the already complex frontier situation.

"If true," Decimus mused, "it changes the strategic calculation. A tribe fleeing disease behaves differently than one preparing for war."

"Though they are not mutually exclusive," another officer pointed out. "Desperation from plague losses might drive them toward Roman territory rather than away from it, seeking resources or simply better conditions."

Titus absorbed these viewpoints, adding them to his own analysis. "This possibility must be considered in our planning," he acknowledged. "But for now, our priority is containing the outbreak within our own camp. We cannot effectively address external threats if we're fighting disease within our walls."

He turned to the camp prefect. "Arrange separate quartering for the isolation cases, away from the main infirmary but with appropriate facilities for the medical staff. Adjust duty rosters to implement the separation protocol Claudius has outlined. And increase rations of vinegar, wine, and fresh vegetables if our stores permit—anything that might help maintain general health."

To his senior centurion, he added, "Prepare a briefing for all officers before dawn. They need to understand both the threat and the containment measures, so they can explain to their men. Emphasize that these are precautionary steps, not cause for alarm."

The officers departed to begin implementing these orders, leaving only Titus, Decimus, and Claudius in the command tent. The physician looked exhausted, the strain of the developing situation evident in his bearing.

"You should rest while you can," Titus told him. "Tomorrow will demand much from all of us, but perhaps most from you and your staff."

Claudius nodded acknowledgment. "I'll return to the infirmary to organize the transfers and brief my assistants. A few hours' sleep afterward, perhaps."

After the physician had departed, Titus turned to Decimus, their long friendship allowing a more candid exchange than had been possible in the formal council.

"Your thoughts?" he asked simply.

"The timing couldn't be worse," Decimus replied, the bluntness that characterized him even more pronounced in private. "Plague within, tribal gathering without, river beginning to freeze between. If there are gods watching, they have a dark sense of humor."

Titus smiled faintly at the grim assessment. "Yet we've faced worse and survived."

"Have we?" Decimus raised an eyebrow. "The combination is unprecedented in my experience. Each alone would be challenging. Together..." He shrugged, leaving the implications unspoken.

"Together they require us to be more adaptable than ever," Titus completed the thought. "Which brings me to Arminius's proposal. The meeting at the river's center."

Decimus frowned. "You're still considering it? With plague in the camp?"

"Perhaps because of the plague in the camp," Titus corrected. "If Claudius is right, and the tribal movements are connected to disease outbreak among their people, this meeting could provide critical intelligence—not just about their military intentions but about the extent of plague beyond the river."

"And if he's wrong? If you expose yourself to a tribal leader who may carry the disease, or who might take the opportunity to eliminate a Roman prefect through treachery rather than battle?"

These were valid concerns, ones that Titus had considered carefully since Valerius had delivered Arminius's message. The risks were undeniable—both personal risk to himself and strategic risk to the frontier defense if something went wrong.

"The meeting would be under truce conditions," Titus noted. "One man from each side, no weapons, no guards within bowshot. Traditional protocols that both sides understand and generally respect."

"Generally," Decimus emphasized. "There have been exceptions throughout history."

"There have," Titus acknowledged. "But consider the alternative—refusing the meeting, preparing only for conflict, perhaps missing an opportunity to understand what truly drives the tribal gathering. If there's even a small chance that unnecessary bloodshed could be avoided, isn't that worth some personal risk?"

Decimus studied his old friend's face, recognizing the determination that had settled there. "You've already decided," he observed, not a question but a statement.

"I've decided to recommend it to the Emperor," Titus clarified. "The final authority rests with him. But yes, I believe the potential benefits outweigh the risks, especially given the complication of plague outbreak within our camp."

Decimus nodded slowly, accepting if not entirely agreeing. "Then I'll focus on ensuring the security arrangements are as robust as possible within the truce conditions. And," he added with a hint of his usual dry humor, "on preparing to assume command should your diplomatic venture prove less successful than hoped."

Titus smiled at the gallows humor that characterized so many veteran officers. "I would expect nothing less. Now, we both need rest before dawn brings the challenges we've just created for ourselves."

After Decimus had departed, Titus remained in the command tent, reviewing the map of the frontier once more. The markers showing known tribal positions had been updated based on the latest scouting reports, revealing a pattern of movement that could indeed be interpreted as either military preparation or response to disease outbreak—or perhaps both simultaneously.

The proposed meeting point was marked as well—a section of the river directly between Carnuntum and the largest concentration of tribal activity on the northern bank. If the Danube froze solid enough to bear weight, as it occasionally did in the deepest winter, it would create a natural neutral ground between the two forces.

Titus traced the river's course with one finger, his mind working through the complex interplay of factors that would shape the coming days—military readiness, disease containment, diplomatic possibilities, the Emperor's strategic priorities, and his own judgment about what best served Rome's interests on this volatile frontier.

The headache that had been threatening all day finally blossomed behind his eyes, a sharp pain that made the map swim momentarily before his vision. He reached for the medicine Claudius had sent earlier, taking a careful dose and waiting for the herbs to dull the worst of the discomfort.

Outside, the night watch called the hour—the deepest part of night, when most of the camp slept while sentries maintained their vigilant watch along the walls and at the river's edge. In a few hours, dawn would bring the implementation of containment measures that would transform the camp's normal routines into a carefully orchestrated effort to control the invisible enemy that had appeared within their ranks.

And beyond the river, whatever gathered in the darkness continued its own preparations, its true nature and intentions still unclear despite all their intelligence gathering. Whether driven by military ambition, the pressure of plague, or some combination of factors, it remained the most significant external threat to the frontier in years.

Titus finally extinguished the lamps and left the command tent, walking through the quiet camp toward his own quarters. The cold night air helped clear his mind, the pain in his head receding slightly as Claudius's medicine began to take effect.

Tomorrow would bring new challenges, new decisions to be made with incomplete information and competing priorities. But for now, he needed the rest that both physician and second-in-command had prescribed—not merely for his own sake but for the camp that looked to him for leadership in this time of compound crises.

The weight of command had never felt heavier, yet neither had the necessity of bearing it well. Too many lives, both Roman and tribal, might depend on the decisions made in the coming days. Titus would face those decisions as he had always tried to face his responsibilities—with clear eyes, steady purpose, and the philosophical perspective that Marcus Aurelius himself had helped instill.

Whatever came across the frozen river, whatever spread through the camp's crowded quarters, he would meet it with the same disciplined response that had carried him through previous crises. Not with the expectation of perfect outcomes—those belonged to the gods, if they existed—but with the determination to make the best possible decisions with the information and resources available.

It was all any commander could do, all any man could do, in the face of circumstances beyond complete control. The Stoic acceptance of this reality brought a measure of peace as Titus finally reached his quarters and prepared for the few hours of rest before dawn would demand his return to duty.
