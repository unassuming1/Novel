# Chapter 6: The Meeting on the Ice

The morning dawned clear and bitterly cold, the kind of day when breath froze in the air and metal stuck to bare skin. Titus stood at the northern wall of Carnuntum, watching as the first light touched the frozen Danube. The river had finally succumbed completely to winter's grip, ice thick enough to bear the weight of men and even horses according to the scouts who had tested it cautiously the previous day.

Three days after the full moon, as Arminius had proposed. The day of the meeting.

"The preparations are complete," Decimus said, joining him at the wall. Like Titus, he wore a heavy winter cloak over his armor, protection against the bone-deep cold that had settled over the frontier.

"The observation positions?" Titus asked, his eyes still on the river and the dark line of the forest beyond.

"Established before dawn, as you ordered. Four locations with clear views of the meeting point, each with our best archers. They'll remain beyond bowshot as agreed, but close enough to respond if the truce is violated."

Titus nodded, satisfied with the precautions. The Emperor's authorization had been explicit—accept the meeting but with robust security arrangements within the constraints of the truce terms. Decimus had overseen these preparations personally, selecting the most reliable men and positioning them with characteristic thoroughness.

"And on their side?" Titus asked.

"Movement in the forest since first light," Decimus replied. "Our observers report small groups approaching the river at multiple points, then withdrawing again. Testing the ice, perhaps. Or establishing their own security positions."

This was expected. Despite the truce conditions, neither side would approach such a meeting without appropriate caution. Trust between Rome and the tribes had never been abundant, and the current circumstances—with unprecedented coordination beyond the river and plague within the Roman camp—made both sides even more wary than usual.

"The latest on the outbreak?" Titus asked, changing focus slightly.

"Claudius reports containment measures appear to be working," Decimus answered. "No new cases in the past two days. Those already infected..." He shrugged slightly, the gesture conveying what words did not need to—that the prognosis remained poor for those who had developed full symptoms.

Titus absorbed this information silently. The plague had claimed twelve men from the garrison thus far, with another eight in isolation showing symptoms. The containment protocols had disrupted normal operations significantly, with the camp effectively divided into separate sections to limit potential spread. Yet the alternative—allowing the disease to move unchecked through the crowded quarters—would have been catastrophic for both health and military readiness.

"The Emperor's dispatch arrived during the night," Titus said after a moment. "Delivered by imperial courier despite the conditions."

Decimus raised an eyebrow slightly, waiting for the content to be shared. Direct communication from Marcus Aurelius always carried particular weight, especially in the current circumstances.

"He approves our assessment and approach," Titus continued. "Including the meeting with Arminius. His instructions emphasize gathering intelligence about tribal intentions and exploring possibilities for avoiding unnecessary conflict, while making no binding commitments without imperial approval."

"As expected," Decimus nodded. "The Emperor has always valued information and understanding before military action."

"There was a personal note as well," Titus added, his voice dropping slightly though there was no one else within hearing distance on the wall. "Philosophical reflections on leadership during crisis, on balancing military necessity with broader human concerns."

Decimus smiled faintly. "Also as expected. Marcus Aurelius the philosopher never entirely gives way to Marcus Aurelius the emperor, even in military correspondence."

It was an observation without criticism. Both men had served under multiple emperors during their long careers, experiencing leadership styles ranging from distant administrative direction to direct battlefield command. Marcus Aurelius's approach—combining clear strategic guidance with philosophical perspective—was unusual but had earned respect throughout the military hierarchy, particularly among frontier commanders who appreciated both the clarity of his directives and the thoughtfulness behind them.

"It's time," Titus said, noting the position of the sun now fully visible above the eastern horizon. "The meeting is set for mid-morning, when visibility is best."

Decimus nodded, his expression growing more serious. "Final review of the approach, then?"

"I'll proceed alone to the meeting point as agreed," Titus confirmed. "Unarmed except for the ceremonial dagger that cannot be removed without violating my oath as an officer." This was a traditional exception in such meetings—the small blade was symbolic rather than practical as a weapon, and both sides understood its significance.

"Arminius should approach similarly from the northern bank," he continued. "We meet at the river's center, visible to observers from both sides but beyond interference distance unless the truce is broken."

"And if it is broken?" Decimus asked, the question that had been at the center of their security planning.

"Then your archers provide covering fire while I retreat to our bank," Titus replied matter-of-factly. "But I don't expect treachery. Arminius initiated this meeting for a purpose. Breaking the truce would defeat that purpose, whatever it may be."

Decimus looked unconvinced but didn't press the point. As second-in-command, he had expressed his reservations about the meeting clearly during their planning sessions. Now that the decision was made, with imperial approval, he focused entirely on ensuring the best possible security arrangements within the constraints they faced.

"I should prepare," Titus said, turning from the wall. "Have my horse ready at the north gate in one hour."

As he walked through the camp toward his quarters, Titus noted the changes that the plague containment measures had created. The normally bustling central areas were subdued, with small groups moving purposefully rather than the usual crowds. Sentries checked anyone crossing between camp sections, enforcing the separation protocol that Claudius had designed. Training continued but in smaller units, with increased distance between men during exercises.

Despite these disruptions, the camp maintained its essential functions. Construction of additional defenses proceeded, though at a somewhat reduced pace. Patrols continued along both the walls and the river, maintaining vigilance despite the strain on available manpower. Supply distribution, administrative functions, equipment maintenance—all continued with the disciplined efficiency that characterized Roman military operations even in crisis.

Titus found a certain pride in this resilience, this capacity to adapt to extraordinary challenges without losing essential purpose or function. It reflected the broader strength of Rome itself—not merely military power but organizational effectiveness, the ability to absorb shocks and continue functioning where less structured societies might collapse.

In his quarters, he found Claudius waiting as arranged. The physician had insisted on examining him before the meeting, concerned about both the physical demands of extended exposure to the bitter cold and the potential for contagion during contact with someone from beyond the frontier.

"You should be resting," Claudius observed dryly as Titus entered. "The headaches won't improve with continued exhaustion."

"There will be time for rest when the frontier is secure," Titus replied, the familiar response in their ongoing negotiation over his health. "Or at least when today's meeting is concluded."

Claudius sighed but didn't belabor the point, instead proceeding with his examination—checking pulse and breathing, examining eyes for signs of the headaches that had plagued Titus with increasing frequency, assessing overall condition with the experienced hands of a physician who had treated everything from gladiatorial wounds to imperial ailments.

"The cold will aggravate the chest tightness," he warned as he completed his assessment. "Breathe through your nose rather than your mouth when possible, and keep the scarf over your face to warm the air before it reaches your lungs."

Titus nodded, accepting the medical advice without comment. The old injury from the Parthian campaign occasionally troubled him in extreme conditions, a legacy of a cavalry skirmish where he had taken a spear blow that should have been fatal. That he had survived at all was considered remarkable by the field surgeons who had treated him; that he had returned to full duty afterward was testament to both his constitution and his determination.

"As for potential contagion," Claudius continued, "maintain distance when possible during the meeting. Avoid direct contact—no clasping of hands or other traditional greetings. If the tribal leader shows any signs of illness—coughing, unusual fatigue, fever—end the meeting as diplomatically as possible and return immediately."

"You believe the plague may have reached them as well?" Titus asked, though the question was largely rhetorical. They had discussed this possibility extensively since Valerius's report about the abandoned villages.

"It seems increasingly likely," Claudius confirmed. "The pattern of tribal movements, the timing relative to our own outbreak, the historical spread patterns of the disease during its previous appearance—all suggest it may be affecting populations beyond the frontier as well as within our own territories."

This possibility had factored significantly into Titus's decision to accept the meeting proposal. If both Roman and tribal forces faced the same invisible enemy, there might be basis for communication that could avoid compounding the plague's toll with unnecessary military casualties.

"I'll take appropriate precautions," he assured the physician. "Both for my own health and to avoid potentially carrying contagion in either direction."

Claudius nodded, satisfied with this commitment. "The herbal preparation for your lungs," he said, presenting a small ceramic container. "Take it before you depart. It will help maintain warmth and reduce the risk of inflammation from the cold air."

After the physician had departed, Titus prepared methodically for the meeting. He chose clothing for both practical protection against the cold and appropriate dignity for a diplomatic encounter—heavy wool tunic and trousers beneath his armor, the winter-weight military cloak with its distinctive red lining, sturdy boots lined with fur, gloves that would protect against frostbite while still allowing necessary dexterity.

The ceremonial dagger went at his belt—the only weapon permitted under the truce terms, its ornate sheath and handle marking it as symbolic rather than practical. He considered briefly whether to wear his full insignia of rank, deciding finally that the situation warranted formal representation of his position as a prefect of Rome.

As he completed these preparations, his mind reviewed the intelligence they had gathered about Arminius—a rising war chief among the Marcomanni, young but already commanding significant respect among the tribal warriors. His clan symbol, the bear, had been found marked in villages traditionally belonging to other tribes, suggesting his influence extended beyond traditional Marcomanni territories.

Beyond these basic facts, however, they knew little about the man himself—his character, his motivations, his ultimate objectives in gathering forces beyond the river. Today's meeting might provide insight into these critical questions, helping shape Rome's response to whatever approached from the darkness of the Germanic forests.

A knock at the door announced Decimus, arriving to accompany him to the north gate where his horse would be waiting. The second-in-command's expression was professionally neutral, but Titus could read the concern beneath it—the natural apprehension of one responsible for security when his commander undertook a potentially dangerous engagement beyond their defensive perimeter.

"The observation positions report all clear," Decimus said as they walked through the camp. "No unusual movements on the northern bank, no signs of preparation for anything beyond the agreed meeting."

"As expected," Titus nodded. "Whatever Arminius's ultimate intentions, I believe his immediate purpose is genuine—to communicate directly before events potentially spiral toward unnecessary conflict."

"Perhaps," Decimus allowed, his natural skepticism evident. "Though communication can serve multiple purposes, not all of them aligned with peace."

This was true enough. Throughout history, diplomatic engagements had sometimes been used to gather intelligence for subsequent military action, to assess opponent's resolve or capabilities, or simply to gain time for further preparation. Titus had considered all these possibilities in deciding to accept the meeting proposal.

"Which is why we maintain appropriate caution," he acknowledged. "Trust but verify, as the old diplomatic maxim suggests."

They reached the north gate, where a small group had gathered despite the bitter cold. Valerius was there, having insisted on accompanying Titus at least to the river's edge—his knowledge of both language and tribal customs potentially valuable if unexpected issues arose. Several centurions stood nearby, their presence unofficial but meaningful—a show of support from the officers who would be responsible for implementing whatever resulted from the day's engagement.

Most surprising was the presence of Claudius, who rarely left the infirmary during daylight hours given the constant demands on his medical expertise. The physician stood slightly apart from the others, his expression suggesting he still harbored reservations about the entire undertaking but had decided his presence was necessary nonetheless.

"A larger audience than I expected," Titus observed quietly to Decimus.

"Word spreads," his second replied with a slight shrug. "The meeting has significance beyond its immediate diplomatic purpose. It represents Rome's approach to the frontier situation—engagement rather than merely defensive preparation."

This was insightful, reflecting Decimus's understanding of the psychological dimensions of command. How Titus handled this meeting, and how it was perceived by those under his command, would influence morale and confidence throughout the garrison regardless of its actual diplomatic outcomes.

He mounted the horse that had been prepared for him—a sturdy bay gelding chosen for its sure-footedness on difficult terrain rather than speed or appearance. The animal's breath formed great clouds in the frigid air, its winter coat providing natural protection against conditions that would challenge human endurance.

"I'll return by midday," Titus told Decimus, loud enough for the gathered officers to hear as well. "Maintain normal operations in my absence, with particular attention to the containment protocols Claudius has established."

With that, he nudged the horse forward, passing through the gate and onto the cleared path that led down to the river. Valerius followed on foot, moving with the natural ease of one accustomed to frontier conditions. Behind them, the gate remained open, observers watching from the wall as the Roman prefect proceeded toward the unprecedented meeting on the frozen Danube.

The approach to the river took only minutes, the path well-maintained despite recent snowfall. As they reached the bank, Titus could see the full expanse of the frozen Danube stretching before them—a white plain marked occasionally by darker patches where the ice was thinner or where snow had been cleared by wind.

The meeting point was clearly visible—a spot near the center of the river where the ice was thickest and most stable according to the scouts who had tested it. No preparations had been made there, no markers or structures erected. The meeting would take place standing on the bare ice, exposed to both the elements and observation from both banks.

"Movement on the northern side," Valerius reported, his keen eyes scanning the tree line beyond the opposite bank. "A single rider approaching the river."

Titus followed his gaze, spotting the figure emerging from the forest—a mounted warrior on a small, shaggy horse typical of the tribal regions. Even at this distance, certain details were visible—the furs and leather of Germanic winter clothing, the long hair and beard that distinguished tribal warriors from their Roman counterparts, the deliberate pace that suggested neither haste nor hesitation.

"Arminius comes alone, as agreed," Valerius confirmed, studying the approaching figure with the experienced eye of one who had lived among the tribes. "The bear clan markings are visible on his cloak."

Titus nodded, satisfied that the initial terms were being honored. "Remain here," he instructed Valerius. "Watch and listen, but do not approach unless I signal specifically for your assistance."

With that, he guided his horse onto the ice, moving carefully to avoid startling the animal on the unfamiliar surface. The river ice creaked occasionally beneath the combined weight but held firm, testament to the deep cold that had gripped the region for weeks.

From the opposite bank, Arminius had also started onto the ice, his smaller horse seemingly more comfortable on the frozen surface than Titus's larger mount. The two men approached the center point simultaneously, each watching the other with the careful assessment of warriors meeting under truce conditions.

As they drew closer, Titus could observe the tribal leader more clearly. Younger than he had expected, perhaps thirty at most, with a physical presence that commanded attention despite his relatively average height and build. His face was marked by a recent scar along the jawline, his beard adorned with small metal beads that clinked softly with each movement. His eyes, however, were what struck Titus most forcefully—intelligent, assessing, with none of the wild ferocity that Roman accounts often attributed to Germanic warriors.

They reached the center point almost simultaneously, stopping their horses about ten paces apart—close enough for conversation without shouting, far enough to maintain both safety and dignity. For a long moment, neither spoke, each taking the measure of the other in the clear winter light.

"Prefect Titus Aelius Gallus," Arminius finally said in heavily accented but understandable Latin. "Commander of Carnuntum and the eastern Danube frontier. Your reputation travels beyond the river."

"Arminius of the Bear Clan," Titus replied with a formal nod. "War chief of the Marcomanni, whose influence appears to extend beyond traditional tribal boundaries."

A faint smile crossed the Germanic leader's bearded face. "We are well-informed about each other, it seems. A useful beginning."

"Information has value," Titus acknowledged. "Though its interpretation determines its true worth."

"Wisely said." Arminius shifted slightly in his saddle, adjusting his position against the bitter cold that enveloped them both. "You accepted my proposal for this meeting despite its unusual nature. I respect that decision."

"The circumstances are unusual," Titus replied simply. "Conventional approaches may not serve either of our peoples in the current situation."

This seemed to satisfy Arminius, who nodded slowly. "Direct and practical. Your reputation is accurate, it seems." He gestured to the frozen river beneath them. "This ice forms a bridge where a barrier once stood. It can be crossed for war or for understanding. Which it becomes depends on what passes between us today."

The metaphor was unexpectedly poetic from a tribal war chief, suggesting an education or perspective beyond what Roman intelligence had indicated. Titus filed this observation away, another piece in the developing picture of the man he faced.

"You proposed this meeting," he said, bringing focus to the engagement. "For what purpose?"

"To prevent unnecessary bloodshed," Arminius replied without hesitation. "What gathers beyond your sight is greater than Rome has faced on this frontier within living memory. Yet war between us is not inevitable, despite appearances."

"Your people move in unprecedented numbers," Titus observed. "Villages abandoned, traditional enemies cooperating, warriors gathering near the frontier. These are not actions that suggest peaceful intentions."

"They are actions of necessity, not choice," Arminius countered. "We face an enemy more terrible than Rome, one that recognizes no boundaries and respects no strength of arms."

"The plague," Titus said, not a question but a statement.

Surprise flickered briefly across Arminius's face before his expression returned to careful neutrality. "Your scouts are observant, and you are perceptive. Yes, the sickness that kills without honor or distinction. It reached our territories last autumn, spreading from village to village despite all efforts to contain it."

This confirmed what they had suspected based on the pattern of tribal movements. The plague had indeed crossed the frontier, affecting the populations beyond the river just as it had devastated communities throughout the empire during its previous appearance.

"It has reached our camp as well," Titus acknowledged, seeing no reason to conceal what Arminius likely already knew from his own intelligence sources. "We implement containment measures, but the disease follows its own course."

"As it does among our people," Arminius nodded grimly. "The weak die quickly. The strong suffer longer but often follow. Those who survive are left weakened for months afterward. No tribe has been spared entirely."

The shared experience of confronting the same invisible enemy created an unexpected common ground between them—Roman prefect and tribal war chief, representatives of worlds typically separated by mutual hostility and incomprehension, now facing the same implacable foe.

"Yet this alone does not explain the gathering of forces we observe," Titus noted, returning to the central concern from Rome's perspective. "Nor the unprecedented cooperation among tribes traditionally hostile to each other."

"It is the beginning of the explanation, not its entirety," Arminius conceded. "The sickness forced movement—abandoning villages where death had taken hold, seeking cleaner territories away from the contamination. But movement requires coordination when many people travel together, especially in winter conditions."

He paused, seemingly considering how much to reveal. "And there is another factor, one that drives both the movement and the cooperation you have observed. Beyond the sickness, beyond the winter, there is pressure from the north."

This was new information, not included in any of their intelligence reports. "What kind of pressure?" Titus asked, his interest sharpened.

"New tribes moving south," Arminius explained. "Peoples from the far northern territories, driven by their own necessities—failed harvests, harsher winters than even they are accustomed to, perhaps the sickness as well though reports are unclear. They press against our traditional lands, forcing choices that would not otherwise be made."

The picture became clearer with this additional context—a complex cascade of factors driving the unprecedented tribal movements. Disease forcing abandonment of contaminated villages. Pressure from northern populations creating additional displacement. Winter conditions necessitating cooperation among groups that would typically remain separate or even hostile.

"So the gathering we observe is defensive rather than offensive in nature?" Titus suggested, testing Arminius's explanation.

"Initially, yes," the tribal leader confirmed. "A response to circumstances beyond our control, not a deliberate preparation for conflict with Rome." He hesitated before adding, "But necessity creates its own momentum. People displaced from their homes, facing sickness and winter hardship, looking across the river at Roman territories largely untouched by these pressures..."

He left the implication unspoken, but it was clear enough. What had begun as defensive movement could easily transform into offensive action if conditions deteriorated further or if opportunity presented itself in the form of Roman weakness.

"You fear this transformation," Titus observed, reading between the lines of Arminius's careful explanation. "You gather these forces for protection but recognize the risk they pose if directed toward the frontier."

A flicker of respect showed in the tribal leader's eyes, acknowledgment of Titus's perceptiveness. "I have seen Rome's strength firsthand in my younger days, when I traveled as far as Aquileia with a trading party. I have no illusions about the outcome of direct conflict between our peoples, even with the numbers we now command."

"Yet others among your war council may hold different views," Titus suggested.

"There are always those who see opportunity where others perceive risk," Arminius acknowledged. "Warriors who believe Roman weakness from the sickness creates a chance for victory that might not come again. Chiefs who remember old grievances and seek redress through force rather than accommodation."

This too aligned with Roman intelligence about tribal politics—the constant tension between more aggressive and more cautious factions, between those who advocated direct confrontation with Rome and those who preferred trading relationships or at least non-hostile coexistence.

"So we face the same challenge," Titus observed. "Maintaining peace when circumstances push toward conflict. Controlling forces that could easily slip beyond governance if not carefully managed."

"Precisely," Arminius nodded, seeming relieved that Titus grasped the situation so clearly. "Which brings us to the purpose of this meeting—not merely to explain what gathers beyond your sight but to explore whether accommodation is possible that serves both our interests."

"What form of accommodation do you envision?" Titus asked, now reaching the heart of the diplomatic engagement.

Arminius straightened in his saddle, his manner becoming more formal as he presented what was clearly a prepared proposal. "Temporary settlement rights in the unoccupied territories south of the river, east of your fortified positions. Land that Rome claims but does not actively use, where our people could establish winter camps until the worst of the sickness has passed and the pressure from the north stabilizes."

It was a bold proposal, one that would have been dismissed immediately under normal circumstances. Roman policy had always been clear—the frontier was absolute, with tribal settlement permitted only beyond the river except in cases of formal alliance or auxiliary service.

Yet these were not normal circumstances. The combination of plague affecting both sides, winter conditions limiting movement, and the unprecedented scale of tribal displacement created a situation that might require more flexible approaches than traditional frontier management.

"Such an arrangement would raise significant concerns," Titus noted carefully. "Questions of security for Roman settlements and outposts. Issues of precedent regarding frontier policy. Challenges of governance and potential conflict between your people and local populations."

"All valid concerns," Arminius acknowledged. "Which is why I propose strict limitations—defined territories with clear boundaries, a fixed duration until spring thaw, hostages exchanged to ensure compliance, immediate withdrawal if any violence occurs against Roman citizens or property."

The proposal was more detailed and pragmatic than Titus had expected, suggesting considerable thought had been given to addressing potential Roman objections. It reflected an understanding of diplomatic realities that went beyond the stereotypical Roman view of tribal leaders as simplistic in their approach to negotiation.

"How many would seek settlement under such an arrangement?" Titus asked, focusing on practical dimensions.

"Perhaps five thousand, including women, children, and elderly," Arminius replied. "Those most vulnerable to winter conditions and the sickness, those for whom the current gathering beyond the river provides inadequate shelter and support."

The number was significant but not overwhelming for the territories in question—largely uninhabited lands that Rome claimed primarily as a buffer zone beyond its actual settlements and military positions. In practical terms, temporary settlement might be manageable, especially with the limitations Arminius proposed.

Yet the political implications remained complex. Such an arrangement would represent a departure from traditional frontier policy, one that would require imperial approval rather than merely local authorization. It would establish a precedent that other tribal groups might seek to exploit in future situations. And it would be viewed with deep suspicion by many within the Roman military and administrative hierarchy.

"This is not a decision I can make unilaterally," Titus said after considering these factors. "It requires consultation with imperial authorities, assessment of broader strategic implications beyond my immediate command area."

"I understand the constraints of your position," Arminius nodded. "As I face similar limitations in what I can promise without the support of other chiefs and clan leaders. But the possibility of such an arrangement, explored in good faith by both sides, might prevent the alternative that neither of us desires."

The unspoken alternative hung between them—conflict along the frontier, with casualties on both sides compounding the toll already taken by the plague. A winter war that would benefit neither Rome nor the tribes, regardless of its eventual outcome.

"I will convey your proposal to the Emperor," Titus decided. "With a full account of the factors you have described—the plague's impact, the pressure from northern tribes, the nature of the gathering we have observed. A response will require time, given the distances involved and the complexity of the issues."

"Time is both ally and enemy in our situation," Arminius observed. "The ice grows thicker with each passing day, making the river more crossable. Hardship increases among our people as winter deepens, creating pressure that becomes harder to contain. Yet hasty decisions in such matters rarely serve either side well."

It was a balanced assessment, acknowledging both the risks of delay and the dangers of precipitous action. Again, Titus noted the tribal leader's capacity for nuanced thinking, so at odds with Roman stereotypes of Germanic chieftains.

"How long can you maintain the current situation?" he asked directly. "Keeping your gathered forces in check, preventing actions that would force a Roman military response?"

Arminius considered the question with evident seriousness. "With the assurance that genuine consideration is being given to our proposal? Perhaps three weeks, possibly a month if conditions don't worsen significantly. Beyond that..." He shrugged slightly, the gesture eloquent in its implication of forces potentially slipping beyond control.

"That should be sufficient for imperial consultation and response," Titus nodded. "Assuming weather permits normal messenger travel to Sirmium and back."

"Then we have the beginning of understanding, if not yet agreement," Arminius concluded. "A foundation on which to build, perhaps."

The meeting had accomplished more than Titus had anticipated—providing crucial context for the tribal gathering, confirming the plague's impact beyond the frontier, and presenting a potential diplomatic alternative to military confrontation. Whether that alternative would prove viable remained to be seen, but the engagement itself represented a significant step toward possible accommodation.

"There is one additional matter," Arminius said as they prepared to conclude the meeting. "A gesture of good faith while imperial consultation proceeds. We have among our people healers who have developed treatments for the sickness—methods that seem to reduce its severity in some cases, though not prevent it entirely. They would share this knowledge with your physicians if permitted."

The offer was unexpected but potentially valuable. Roman medicine was advanced in many respects, but the plague had challenged even the empire's finest physicians. Different approaches, developed through the tribal experience with the disease, might provide insights or techniques not yet explored by Roman medical practice.

"Our chief physician would welcome such an exchange," Titus replied after brief consideration. "Knowledge that might save lives on either side of the river serves both our peoples."

"I will send two healers under truce banner tomorrow," Arminius proposed. "They will bring their medicines and methods to share with your physicians, remaining as long as needed to demonstrate their application."

"They will be received with appropriate respect and protection," Titus assured him. "And may return to your people whenever they wish."

With this final arrangement established, the two leaders prepared to depart, each returning to their respective banks and the forces that awaited their report of the unprecedented meeting. As they turned their horses, Arminius offered a final observation.

"The Romans believe they civilize the world through conquest," he said, his tone thoughtful rather than confrontational. "Perhaps there are other paths to understanding between peoples, paths that need not be marked by blood."

"Perhaps," Titus acknowledged, struck by the philosophical nature of the comment. "Though history suggests such paths are rarely easy to find or follow."

"Yet here we stand," Arminius gestured to the ice beneath them, "meeting as men rather than enemies, seeking solutions rather than victories. If nothing else comes from this day, that itself holds meaning."

With that, he turned his horse and began the journey back to the northern bank, his figure gradually diminishing against the backdrop of the dark forest beyond. Titus watched for a moment before guiding his own mount toward the southern shore, where Valerius waited with evident relief that the meeting had concluded without incident.

As they made their way back toward Carnuntum, Titus reflected on the engagement and its implications. The tribal gathering beyond the river was now better understood—not primarily a military threat, at least in its original purpose, but a complex response to multiple pressures affecting the Germanic populations. The plague's impact extended across the frontier, creating shared challenges that might form the basis for unprecedented cooperation rather than conflict.

And Arminius himself had proven far more sophisticated than Roman intelligence had suggested—a leader with strategic vision and diplomatic skill, seeking accommodation rather than confrontation despite the significant forces at his command. Whether his proposal for temporary settlement would prove viable remained uncertain, but the fact that such an alternative had been presented at all represented a significant development in frontier relations.

The gates of Carnuntum came into view, sentries watching attentively as their prefect returned from the diplomatic mission. Beyond the walls, the camp continued its disciplined routine despite the disruptions of plague containment measures—a visible reminder of Roman resilience and organizational effectiveness even in crisis.

Decimus waited at the gate, his expression carefully neutral but his posture betraying the relief he felt at his commander's safe return. Behind him stood Claudius, whose medical concerns clearly hadn't abated during Titus's absence, and several centurions whose presence represented the garrison's interest in the outcome of this unprecedented engagement.

"The meeting was productive," Titus announced as he dismounted, his voice carrying to the gathered officers. "We have gained valuable intelligence about the situation beyond the river, and a potential diplomatic path that may serve Rome's interests better than immediate military confrontation."

He would provide full details in the command tent, away from the general audience of the gate area. But this initial statement served an important purpose—establishing the meeting as a successful initiative rather than a questionable departure from conventional frontier management. How the officers perceived and subsequently presented the engagement to their men would significantly influence morale and confidence throughout the garrison.

As he walked with Decimus and the senior officers toward the command center, Titus was already composing in his mind the dispatch that would convey Arminius's proposal to the Emperor. The report would need to be comprehensive yet concise, presenting both the tribal leader's specific suggestions and the broader context that made them worthy of serious consideration despite their departure from traditional frontier policy.

Marcus Aurelius would make the final determination, weighing diplomatic, military, and political factors from an imperial perspective that encompassed far more than the immediate frontier situation. But Titus's assessment and recommendation would carry significant weight in that decision, given his direct command responsibility and firsthand engagement with Arminius.

The weight of that responsibility settled on his shoulders as he entered the command tent, preparing to brief his officers on the meeting that might determine whether the coming weeks would bring negotiation or conflict along the frozen Danube frontier. Whatever path ultimately emerged, this day had created possibilities that hadn't existed before—alternatives to the seemingly inevitable confrontation that had loomed as tribal forces gathered beyond the river.

Whether those possibilities would lead to sustainable accommodation or merely delay an eventual clash remained to be seen. But for now, a bridge of understanding had been established where only a barrier had existed before—a development that served the interests of both Rome and the tribes as they faced the combined challenges of winter, plague, and the complex human dynamics that shaped frontier relations in this remote corner of the empire.
