# Chapter 6: The Meeting on the Ice

The morning dawned clear and bitter cold—the kind of day when breath froze in the air and metal stuck to bare skin. Titus stood at Carnuntum's northern wall, watching first light touch the frozen Danube. The river had finally surrendered to winter's grip, ice thick enough to bear men and even horses according to scouts who had tested it cautiously the day before.

Three days after the full moon, as Arminius had proposed. The day of the meeting.

"Preparations complete," Decimus said, joining him at the wall. Like Titus, he wore a heavy winter cloak over his armor against the bone-deep cold that had settled over the frontier.

"The observation positions?" Titus asked, eyes still fixed on the river and the dark line of forest beyond.

"Established before dawn, as ordered. Four locations with clear views of the meeting point, each with our best archers. They'll remain beyond bowshot as agreed, but close enough to respond if the truce breaks."

Titus nodded, satisfied. The Emperor's authorization had been explicit—accept the meeting but with robust security within the truce constraints. Decimus had overseen these preparations personally, selecting the most reliable men and positioning them with characteristic thoroughness.

"And their side?" Titus asked.

"Movement in the forest since first light," Decimus replied. "Our observers report small groups approaching the river at multiple points, then withdrawing. Testing the ice, perhaps. Or establishing their own security positions."

This was expected. Despite the truce conditions, neither side would approach such a meeting without caution. Trust between Rome and the tribes had never been abundant, and current circumstances—with unprecedented coordination beyond the river and plague within the Roman camp—made both sides even warier than usual.

"The outbreak?" Titus asked, shifting focus.

"Claudius says containment measures seem to be working," Decimus answered. "No new cases in two days. Those already infected..." He shrugged slightly, the gesture conveying what words didn't need to—that the prognosis remained poor for those with full symptoms.

Titus absorbed this silently. The plague had claimed twelve men from the garrison, with another eight in isolation showing symptoms. The containment protocols had disrupted normal operations significantly, with the camp effectively divided into separate sections to limit potential spread. Yet the alternative—allowing the disease to move unchecked through crowded quarters—would have been catastrophic for both health and military readiness.

"The Emperor's dispatch arrived during the night," Titus said after a moment. "Delivered by imperial courier despite the conditions."

Decimus raised an eyebrow slightly, waiting for the content to be shared. Direct communication from Marcus Aurelius always carried particular weight.

"He approves our assessment and approach," Titus continued. "Including the meeting with Arminius. His instructions emphasize gathering intelligence about tribal intentions and exploring possibilities for avoiding unnecessary conflict, while making no binding commitments without imperial approval."

"As expected," Decimus nodded. "The Emperor has always valued information and understanding before military action."

"There was a personal note as well," Titus added, his voice dropping though no one else stood within hearing distance. "Philosophical reflections on leadership during crisis, on balancing military necessity with broader human concerns."

Decimus smiled faintly. "Also as expected. Marcus Aurelius the philosopher never entirely gives way to Marcus Aurelius the emperor, even in military correspondence."

It was an observation without criticism. Both men had served under multiple emperors during their careers, experiencing leadership styles ranging from distant administrative direction to direct battlefield command. Marcus Aurelius's approach—combining clear strategic guidance with philosophical perspective—was unusual but had earned respect throughout the military hierarchy, particularly among frontier commanders who appreciated both the clarity of his directives and the thoughtfulness behind them.

"It's time," Titus said, noting the sun now fully visible above the eastern horizon. "The meeting is set for mid-morning, when visibility is best."

Decimus nodded, his expression growing more serious. "Final review of the approach?"

"I'll proceed alone to the meeting point as agreed," Titus confirmed. "Unarmed except for the ceremonial dagger that cannot be removed without violating my oath as an officer." This was a traditional exception in such meetings—the small blade was symbolic rather than practical as a weapon, and both sides understood its significance.

"Arminius should approach similarly from the northern bank," he continued. "We meet at the river's center, visible to observers from both sides but beyond interference distance unless the truce breaks."

"And if it does break?" Decimus asked, the question that had centered their security planning.

"Then your archers provide covering fire while I retreat to our bank," Titus replied matter-of-factly. "But I don't expect treachery. Arminius initiated this meeting for a purpose. Breaking the truce would defeat that purpose, whatever it may be."

Decimus looked unconvinced but didn't press the point. As second-in-command, he had expressed his reservations clearly during their planning sessions. Now that the decision was made, with imperial approval, he focused entirely on ensuring the best possible security arrangements within the constraints they faced.

"I should prepare," Titus said, turning from the wall. "Have my horse ready at the north gate in one hour."

As he walked through the camp toward his quarters, Titus noted the changes that plague containment had created. The normally bustling central areas were subdued, with small groups moving purposefully rather than the usual crowds. Sentries checked anyone crossing between camp sections, enforcing the separation protocol that Claudius had designed. Training continued but in smaller units, with increased distance between men during exercises.

Despite these disruptions, the camp maintained its essential functions. Construction of additional defenses proceeded, though at a somewhat reduced pace. Patrols continued along both the walls and the river, maintaining vigilance despite the strain on available manpower. Supply distribution, administrative functions, equipment maintenance—all continued with the disciplined efficiency that characterized Roman military operations even in crisis.

In his quarters, he found Claudius waiting as arranged. The physician had insisted on examining him before the meeting, concerned about both the physical demands of extended exposure to the bitter cold and the potential for contagion during contact with someone from beyond the frontier.

"You should be resting," Claudius observed dryly as Titus entered. "The headaches won't improve with continued exhaustion."

"There will be time for rest when the frontier is secure," Titus replied, their familiar refrain. "Or at least when today's meeting concludes."

Claudius sighed but didn't belabor the point, instead proceeding with his examination—checking pulse and breathing, examining eyes for signs of the headaches that had plagued Titus with increasing frequency, assessing overall condition with the experienced hands of a physician who had treated everything from gladiatorial wounds to imperial ailments.

"The cold will aggravate the chest tightness," he warned as he finished. "Breathe through your nose rather than your mouth when possible, and keep the scarf over your face to warm the air before it reaches your lungs."

Titus nodded, accepting the advice without comment. The old injury from the Parthian campaign occasionally troubled him in extreme conditions, a legacy of a cavalry skirmish where he had taken a spear blow that should have been fatal. That he had survived at all was considered remarkable by the field surgeons who had treated him; that he had returned to full duty afterward was testament to both his constitution and his determination.

"As for potential contagion," Claudius continued, "maintain distance during the meeting. Avoid direct contact—no clasping of hands or other traditional greetings. If the tribal leader shows any signs of illness—coughing, unusual fatigue, fever—end the meeting as diplomatically as possible and return immediately."

"You believe the plague may have reached them as well?" Titus asked, though the question was largely rhetorical. They had discussed this possibility extensively since Valerius's report about the abandoned villages.

"It seems increasingly likely," Claudius confirmed. "The pattern of tribal movements, the timing relative to our own outbreak, the historical spread patterns of the disease during its previous appearance—all suggest it may be affecting populations beyond the frontier as well as within our own territories."

This possibility had factored significantly into Titus's decision to accept the meeting proposal. If both Roman and tribal forces faced the same invisible enemy, there might be basis for communication that could avoid compounding the plague's toll with unnecessary military casualties.

"I'll take appropriate precautions," he assured the physician. "Both for my own health and to avoid potentially carrying contagion in either direction."

Claudius nodded, satisfied. "The herbal preparation for your lungs," he said, presenting a small ceramic container. "Take it before you depart. It will help maintain warmth and reduce the risk of inflammation from the cold air."

After the physician had departed, Titus prepared methodically for the meeting. He chose clothing for both practical protection against the cold and appropriate dignity for a diplomatic encounter—heavy wool tunic and trousers beneath his armor, the winter-weight military cloak with its distinctive red lining, sturdy boots lined with fur, gloves that would protect against frostbite while still allowing necessary dexterity.

The ceremonial dagger went at his belt—the only weapon permitted under the truce terms, its ornate sheath and handle marking it as symbolic rather than practical. He considered briefly whether to wear his full insignia of rank, deciding finally that the situation warranted formal representation of his position as a prefect of Rome.

As he completed these preparations, his mind reviewed the intelligence they had gathered about Arminius—a rising war chief among the Marcomanni, young but already commanding significant respect among the tribal warriors. His clan symbol, the bear, had been found marked in villages traditionally belonging to other tribes, suggesting his influence extended beyond traditional Marcomanni territories.

Beyond these basic facts, however, they knew little about the man himself—his character, his motivations, his ultimate objectives in gathering forces beyond the river. Today's meeting might provide insight into these critical questions, helping shape Rome's response to whatever approached from the darkness of the Germanic forests.

A knock at the door announced Decimus, arriving to accompany him to the north gate where his horse would be waiting. The second-in-command's expression was professionally neutral, but Titus could read the concern beneath it—the natural apprehension of one responsible for security when his commander undertook a potentially dangerous engagement beyond their defensive perimeter.

"The observation positions report all clear," Decimus said as they walked through the camp. "No unusual movements on the northern bank, no signs of preparation for anything beyond the agreed meeting."

"As expected," Titus nodded. "Whatever Arminius's ultimate intentions, I believe his immediate purpose is genuine—to communicate directly before events potentially spiral toward unnecessary conflict."

At the north gate, a small group had gathered despite the bitter cold. Valerius stood beside a saddled horse, his expression unreadable. As the scout who had encountered Arminius directly and carried his message back to Carnuntum, he had a unique perspective on the tribal leader—one that Titus had considered carefully in his decision to accept the meeting proposal.

"Any last-minute intelligence?" Titus asked him.

Valerius shook his head. "Nothing beyond what we've already discussed, Prefect. The northern bank remains quiet except for the expected security positions. No signs of larger forces moving toward the river."

Titus nodded, accepting this assessment. Valerius had proven consistently reliable in his observations, combining his frontier-born instincts with Roman military training to provide intelligence that was both accurate and insightful.

Claudius stood nearby, medical satchel in hand. The Emperor's instructions had specified that the physician should accompany the meeting party, though he would remain at a distance during the actual conversation between Titus and Arminius.

"Remember the breathing techniques we discussed," the physician said quietly as Titus prepared to mount. "And the warning signs of cold exposure—numbness in extremities, slurred speech, confusion. Don't allow diplomatic concerns to override medical necessities."

Titus acknowledged this with a nod, appreciating the physician's concern while knowing that the realities of frontier command sometimes required pushing physical limits beyond medical advisability. It was a balance he had navigated throughout his career, particularly since the Parthian injury that had nearly ended both his service and his life.

With final instructions to Decimus regarding camp management during his absence, Titus mounted and led the small party through the gate. Behind him rode Claudius and two trusted legionaries who would remain at the Roman bank as observers, close enough to witness but too distant to intervene immediately if the truce was violated.

The morning had warmed slightly as the sun rose higher, though "warm" remained a relative term in the depths of a Danubian winter. Their breath still clouded heavily in the air, and the snow crunched beneath the horses' hooves as they made their way toward the river.

The Danube stretched before them, its familiar flowing surface transformed into a white plain broken only by occasional dark patches where the ice was thinner or where snow had been swept away by wind. In summer, this crossing would have required boats and exposed those making the journey to potential attack from either bank. Now, the frozen surface created a temporary bridge between Roman and tribal territories—an opportunity for direct communication, but also a potential invasion route if the ice remained solid long enough for military movement.

As they approached the bank, Titus could see movement on the northern side—a small party emerging from the forest edge, matching their own in number. Four figures on horseback, one slightly ahead of the others, presumably Arminius himself.

"They maintain the agreed approach," Valerius observed quietly. "Four riders, only one proceeding to the center."

Titus nodded, studying the distant figures. Even at this range, the tribal leader was distinctive—taller than his companions, wearing what appeared to be a bearskin cloak over his shoulders, the animal's head forming a hood that partially obscured his face.

"Remain here," Titus instructed his companions as they reached the river's edge. "Maintain observation but do not approach unless I signal. If the truce is violated, return to the camp immediately and implement the contingency plans we've discussed."

Without waiting for acknowledgment, he urged his horse forward onto the ice. The animal moved cautiously at first, uncertain of the footing, but gained confidence as the surface proved solid beneath its hooves. Titus maintained a steady pace, neither hurrying nor hesitating, his posture deliberately relaxed despite the tension he felt internally.

From the northern bank, Arminius had also started forward, his horse picking its way carefully across the frozen river. The two men approached the center at similar speeds, each watching the other's movement while maintaining awareness of their surroundings.

They reached the midpoint almost simultaneously, bringing their horses to a halt about ten paces apart—close enough for conversation without shouting, distant enough to provide reaction time if either made a threatening move.

For a long moment, neither spoke. Titus took the opportunity to study the tribal leader directly. Arminius was younger than he had expected, perhaps thirty, with a face that combined the weathered hardness of a frontier warrior with an unexpected intelligence in his eyes. The bearskin cloak was clearly ceremonial rather than merely practical, the bear's head positioned to frame his face rather than serve as a hood. Beneath it, he wore layers of fur and leather against the cold, with what appeared to be chain mail visible at his neck—Roman manufacture, Titus noted, likely taken in battle or obtained through trade.

"Prefect Titus Aelius Gallus," Arminius finally spoke, his Latin accented but fluent. "You honor the old customs by coming yourself rather than sending subordinates."

"War Chief Arminius," Titus replied in the formal mode of address appropriate for tribal leaders. "Your message suggested matters of sufficient importance to warrant direct communication."

A slight smile touched Arminius's bearded face. "Direct indeed. No interpreters to soften meanings or diplomats to obscure intentions. Warrior to warrior, as it should be when lives hang in the balance."

Titus inclined his head slightly, acknowledging the sentiment without explicitly agreeing. "You requested this meeting. I have come as proposed, under the ancient truce conditions. What would you communicate that could not be conveyed through established channels?"

Arminius shifted in his saddle, adjusting his position to ease what appeared to be discomfort in his left side—an old injury, perhaps, or simply the natural stiffness that came with extended exposure to the bitter cold.

"What approaches from beyond the river is not what you believe it to be," he said directly. "Not merely a war gathering, though it may appear so to your scouts and sentries."

"What is it, then?" Titus asked, maintaining a neutral expression despite his intense interest in this confirmation of their intelligence about tribal movements.

"Survival," Arminius replied simply. "The tribes move south not primarily for war but because remaining in their traditional territories has become untenable. The sickness that now affects your camp struck our villages first, months ago. It spreads like fire through dry grass, killing many and leaving others weakened."

This aligned with what Claudius had suspected based on the pattern of abandoned settlements and the timing of the plague's appearance in Carnuntum. Still, Titus maintained appropriate skepticism.

"Disease affects all peoples," he acknowledged. "But it does not explain the unprecedented coordination among tribes that have traditionally been hostile to each other. Nor the apparent preparation for river crossings at multiple points along the frontier."

Arminius nodded, as if appreciating the Roman's unwillingness to accept simple explanations for complex situations. "The sickness is only part. The harvest failed in the northern territories—too much rain early, then drought. Game has grown scarce. And the winter came earlier and harder than any in living memory."

He gestured at the frozen river between them. "This—ice thick enough to bear weight so early in the season—has not been seen in generations. The elders speak of it as an omen, though of what they do not agree."

"So hunger drives the tribes south as much as disease," Titus summarized, beginning to see the fuller picture. "Toward Roman territories with their stored grain and sheltered settlements."

"Yes," Arminius confirmed. "But not necessarily toward war, despite what many of my warriors desire. There are other possibilities, if Rome is willing to consider them."

This was unexpected—a tribal leader suggesting alternatives to the traditional pattern of raid and reprisal that had characterized frontier relations for generations. Titus's interest sharpened further, though he kept his expression carefully neutral.

"What possibilities do you envision?" he asked.

Arminius leaned forward slightly, his voice dropping though there was no one else within hearing distance. "Temporary settlement in the buffer territories between the river and your fortified line. Land that Rome claims but does not actively farm or patrol. My people would establish winter camps there, remaining until spring allows return to our traditional hunting grounds."

It was a bold proposal—essentially requesting Roman permission for what would otherwise be considered an invasion of imperial territory. Yet it also represented a potential alternative to outright conflict, one that acknowledged Roman authority while addressing the tribes' immediate survival needs.

"And in exchange?" Titus asked, knowing that such proposals always came with reciprocal expectations.

"Peace along the frontier," Arminius replied promptly. "No raids against Roman settlements or outposts. No interference with trade routes. And—" he paused, seemingly weighing his next words carefully, "—alliance against those tribes that refuse these terms and choose violence instead."

This last point was particularly significant—a tribal leader offering not just to refrain from attacking Rome but to actively assist against other tribal groups that might threaten the frontier. Such arrangements had precedent in Roman frontier policy, but they were typically established after military defeat had demonstrated Rome's overwhelming power, not as preventive measures before conflict erupted.

"You speak for all the tribes gathering beyond the river?" Titus asked, knowing the answer but needing to establish the limits of Arminius's authority.

A shadow crossed the war chief's face. "I speak for the Bear Clan of the Marcomanni directly. For the Wolf Clan of the Quadi and the Hawk Clan of the Iazyges by agreement of their leaders. Others follow our lead for now, but their loyalty is to survival rather than to me personally. If I cannot provide a path that preserves their people, they will seek their own solutions—likely more violent ones."

This confirmed what Roman intelligence had already suggested—that the tribal coordination was real but fragile, centered around Arminius's leadership but not guaranteed to hold if circumstances changed or if his approach failed to address the immediate crisis.

"And the sickness?" Titus asked, shifting to the other major concern. "If your people carry it with them, settlement near our territories risks spreading the contagion further."

Arminius nodded grimly. "The sickness has already taken its toll among my people. Many died in the early moons of its spread. Those who survived seem resistant to falling ill again. But yes, some still carry the disease. This is why we propose settlement away from your populated areas, with controlled contact only through designated meeting points."

It was a reasonable approach to the contagion risk, similar in some ways to the containment protocols Claudius had implemented within the Roman camp. Still, the practical challenges of managing such an arrangement would be substantial, particularly given the traditional distrust between Romans and tribes.

"Your proposal requires careful consideration," Titus said after a moment's reflection. "It involves matters of imperial policy that exceed my authority as a frontier prefect."

"I understand Rome's chains of command," Arminius replied with a slight smile. "Just as I understand that a prefect of your experience has significant influence on how situations are presented to those higher in that chain."

The observation was accurate enough to draw a small nod of acknowledgment from Titus. While final decisions on frontier policy rested with the Emperor and his advisors in Sirmium, the assessments and recommendations of commanders on the ground carried substantial weight in those deliberations.

"There is another factor you should be aware of," Arminius continued, his expression growing more serious. "Not all tribal leaders favor this approach. Some—particularly among the younger warriors who have not seen the full cost of war with Rome—argue for traditional raiding instead. They believe that if enough pressure is applied along the frontier, Rome will withdraw rather than commit resources to a winter campaign."

"A miscalculation," Titus observed dryly.

"So I have told them," Arminius agreed. "But hunger and desperation make poor counselors, and the young often confuse ferocity with strategy."

He shifted again in his saddle, and Titus noticed a momentary grimace of pain cross his face—quickly controlled but visible nonetheless. The tribal leader was either injured or ill, though clearly determined not to show weakness during this crucial meeting.

"Time grows short," Arminius continued, glancing briefly at the sun's position. "The ice will not hold forever, and decisions must be made before it breaks. My proposal is offered in good faith, Prefect Gallus. Consider it with the wisdom I believe you possess, rather than the suspicion that typically characterizes Rome's approach to the tribes."

Titus studied the man before him, weighing what he had heard against what he knew of tribal patterns and motivations. There was sincerity in Arminius's presentation, but also calculation—the natural pragmatism of a leader facing impossible choices and seeking the least devastating path forward for his people.

"I will present your proposal accurately to my superiors," Titus finally said. "Including both the opportunities and risks it presents. A response will require time—days rather than hours."

"We have perhaps a week before the more aggressive factions force action," Arminius replied. "After that, I cannot guarantee that the coalition will hold to peaceful intentions."

"Understood," Titus nodded. "One question remains, however. Why approach me directly? Why not send emissaries through established channels, as is customary when tribes wish to negotiate with Rome?"

Arminius's expression shifted subtly, becoming more personal and less formal. "Because I have measured you, Titus Aelius Gallus. Three winters ago, when we met during the truce talks at the river bend. You spoke then of honor that transcends boundaries, of the waste of unnecessary bloodshed, of the possibility that Rome and the tribes might find better ways to share these territories than endless cycles of raid and reprisal."

Titus remembered the encounter, though he was surprised that Arminius had attached such significance to what had been, from the Roman perspective, a relatively routine diplomatic exchange during a temporary winter truce.

"Many speak of peace when it serves immediate purposes," he observed. "Fewer maintain such commitments when circumstances change."

"True of both Romans and tribes," Arminius acknowledged. "Yet here we are, meeting as equals on the frozen river, seeking alternatives to the bloodshed that would otherwise surely come. That suggests something beyond mere expedience, does it not?"

Before Titus could respond, a shout came from the southern bank—one of his observers signaling urgently. Simultaneously, he noticed increased activity at the tree line on the northern side, with several riders emerging from the forest at speed.

"It seems our time grows shorter than expected," Arminius observed, turning to look at the approaching riders from his side. "My brother Segestes—impetuous and suspicious by nature. He likely fears I reveal too much or concede too readily."

"We should conclude," Titus agreed, noting that Decimus had mounted and appeared ready to ride out onto the ice despite the truce conditions. "Your proposal will be conveyed to the appropriate authorities. A response will come as quickly as circumstances allow."

Arminius nodded, then reached beneath his bearskin cloak to withdraw a small object—a carved wooden token bearing the bear symbol of his clan. "For verification of any future messages," he explained, extending it toward Titus. "My mark, known to my people. Any communication bearing this or its likeness comes with my authority."

Titus accepted the token with a formal nod, recognizing the significance of such an exchange in tribal custom. "Three days," he said. "Return to this place at midday. I will have at least a preliminary response by then."

"Three days," Arminius confirmed. Then, with a slight smile that contained both hope and skepticism: "May wisdom guide your deliberations, Prefect of Rome."

With that, he turned his horse and began the journey back to the northern bank, where his brother and several warriors now waited at the edge of the ice. Titus likewise turned toward the southern shore, where Decimus, Claudius, and the others watched with evident tension.

As he rode, Titus's mind was already analyzing the conversation, identifying key points to include in his report to Sirmium. Arminius's proposal represented a potential alternative to what had seemed an inevitable winter conflict—one that would be costly for both sides, particularly with plague already affecting the Roman garrison and likely spreading among the tribal populations as well.

Yet the practical challenges of such an arrangement would be substantial. Allowing tribal settlement, even temporarily, in territories claimed by Rome would be seen by many as weakness or concession. Monitoring compliance with the proposed terms would require resources already stretched thin by the plague outbreak. And the fragile nature of Arminius's coalition meant that even if an agreement was reached, some tribal factions might reject it and pursue violence regardless.

Reaching the bank, Titus dismounted, immediately noting the concern on Decimus's face.

"Trouble?" he asked quietly.

"Movement in the forests beyond our observation posts," Decimus replied. "Larger groups than before, appearing briefly then withdrawing again. Could be preparation for an attack, or simply repositioning of their forces."

"Or internal disagreement among the tribal factions," Titus suggested, recalling Arminius's comments about divisions within the coalition. "The war chief indicated that not all tribal leaders support his approach."

"What approach is that?" Claudius asked, joining them after ensuring Titus showed no immediate signs of cold injury or illness.

"A proposal that requires careful consideration," Titus replied, not yet ready to share the details until he had organized his thoughts more completely. "We should return to the camp. I need to prepare a dispatch to Sirmium immediately."

As they rode back toward Carnuntum's walls, Titus found himself reflecting on Arminius's reference to their previous meeting—an encounter he remembered but had not considered particularly significant at the time. That the tribal leader had not only remembered it but attached enough importance to it to base his current approach on that interaction suggested a complexity to the man that went beyond the typical Roman view of tribal leaders as simplistic warriors driven primarily by immediate advantage.

The wooden token felt heavy in his belt pouch, a tangible symbol of the unexpected connection that had formed across the boundary that separated their worlds. Whether that connection would lead to a peaceful resolution of the current crisis or merely complicate an inevitable conflict remained to be seen. But the possibility itself represented something rare and valuable on this harsh frontier—an opening, however small, for alternatives to the endless cycle of violence that had defined Roman-tribal relations for generations.

The gates of Carnuntum opened to admit them, closing quickly behind to preserve the camp's warmth. As Titus dismounted and handed the reins to a waiting groom, he noticed Valerius watching him with an expression of quiet interest.

"The war chief spoke truth about the tribal movements?" the scout asked, falling into step beside him as they walked toward the principia.

"Partially," Titus replied. "As is usually the case with such matters. The full situation is more complex than either simple hostility or straightforward peaceful intentions."

Valerius nodded, unsurprised. Born in the frontier region to a Pannonian mother and a father who had served in the auxiliaries, he understood better than most Romans the nuanced realities of tribal politics and motivations.

"He seemed sincere when he spoke to me in the abandoned settlement," the scout observed. "About enough blood being spilled already. But sincerity and capability are different matters. Even if he truly wishes to avoid conflict, he may not be able to control all the factions gathering beyond the river."

"A concern he acknowledged directly," Titus confirmed. "The coalition is real but fragile, centered around his leadership but not guaranteed to hold if circumstances change or if his approach fails to address the immediate crisis."

They had reached the principia, where Decimus was already organizing the senior officers for a briefing on the meeting's outcome. Titus paused before entering, looking back toward the northern wall and the frozen river beyond.

"Prepare for a follow-up meeting three days from now," he instructed Valerius. "Same location, same security arrangements. And increase surveillance of the northern bank in the meantime. I want to know if the tribal movements suggest preparation for attack or continued adherence to the truce conditions."

The scout nodded and departed to implement these instructions, leaving Titus to face the questions and concerns that would inevitably arise from his officers once they learned of Arminius's unexpected proposal. Some would see opportunity in the potential for avoiding unnecessary conflict; others would perceive risk in any approach that deviated from traditional Roman responses to tribal pressure along the frontier.

Navigating these perspectives while formulating his own recommendation to Sirmium would require all the diplomatic skill and strategic judgment he had developed during his years of frontier command. The stakes were high—not just for the immediate security of Carnuntum and its surrounding territories, but potentially for the longer-term relationship between Rome and the tribes beyond the Danube.

As he entered the principia to begin this process, Titus felt the weight of the wooden token in his pouch—a small thing in itself, yet representative of the unexpected possibility that had emerged from the meeting on the ice. Whether that possibility would lead to peace or merely a different form of conflict remained to be seen. But the fact that it existed at all, in circumstances that would typically lead directly to bloodshed, suggested that perhaps there were indeed alternatives to the endless cycle of violence that had defined this frontier for generations.

The coming days would determine whether such alternatives could move from possibility to reality—and whether the leaders on both sides of the frozen river possessed the wisdom and courage to pursue them despite the substantial risks and challenges they presented.
