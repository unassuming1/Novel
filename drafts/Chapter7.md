# Chapter 7: The Healers

The two tribal healers arrived at Carnuntum's north gate shortly after dawn, as Arminius had promised. They stood patiently in the bitter cold, their breath forming clouds in the still air, waiting as sentries verified their identity and purpose. Both were women—one elderly with silver-streaked hair braided elaborately beneath a fur hood, the other younger, perhaps thirty, with the watchful eyes of one accustomed to observing symptoms and changes in patients.

They carried simple packs containing their medicines and implements, and wore no weapons—not even the small knives that tribal people typically carried for everyday tasks. This complete adherence to the truce terms had been Arminius's instruction, they explained through Valerius, who had been summoned to translate. Nothing should impede their mission to share healing knowledge with the Roman physicians.

Claudius Galenus waited for them in a small building adjacent to the main infirmary—a space hastily prepared for this unprecedented exchange. The structure had previously served as storage for medical supplies but had been cleared and furnished with a table, benches, and a small brazier that provided welcome warmth against the winter chill.

"Welcome to Carnuntum," Claudius greeted them in Latin as they entered, Valerius translating his words into the tribal dialect. "I am Claudius Galenus, chief physician of this garrison. Your willingness to share knowledge that may save lives on both sides of the river is appreciated."

The elder woman nodded acknowledgment, her expression revealing neither warmth nor hostility—merely the professional assessment of one healer meeting another. "I am Hulda of the Bear Clan," she replied through Valerius. "This is my apprentice, Frieda. We bring methods developed through our people's suffering, in the hope that shared knowledge may reduce death's harvest among both our peoples."

The formal introduction completed, they moved to the table where Claudius had arranged his own medical implements and preparations—an intentional display of Roman medical advancement, but also a practical starting point for comparing approaches to treating the plague. Surgical tools of bronze and iron, ceramic containers of herbal preparations, scrolls containing medical texts from his personal collection—all arranged with the methodical precision that characterized his practice.

Hulda studied these items with evident interest, recognizing some and showing curiosity about others. She then unpacked her own materials—leather pouches containing dried herbs and powders, small wooden containers of salves and tinctures, bundles of what appeared to be tree bark and fungi, several implements carved from bone and antler.

"The sickness follows patterns," she began, speaking directly to the core of their shared challenge without preamble. "It begins with fever and weakness, then attacks the lungs and spreads purple marks across the skin. Those who survive the seventh day may recover, though many remain weakened for months afterward."

Claudius nodded, recognizing the same progression he had observed. "Our experience matches yours. The disease spreads before symptoms appear, making isolation of visible cases insufficient to contain it. We have found no reliable cure, though certain treatments seem to reduce suffering in some cases."

This honest acknowledgment of the limits of Roman medicine seemed to establish a foundation of trust between them. Hulda nodded approvingly, perhaps having expected more arrogance from the imperial physician.

"We too have found no certain cure," she admitted. "But through many deaths and careful observation, we have developed methods that appear to increase the chance of survival, particularly for those not already weakened by age or previous illness."

What followed was a detailed exchange of medical knowledge unlike any Claudius had experienced in his extensive career. Hulda described treatments developed through generations of tribal healing tradition, now adapted specifically for the plague—teas brewed from specific combinations of herbs and fungi, poultices applied to the chest to ease breathing, methods of reducing fever through controlled exposure to cold followed by gradual warming.

Most intriguing was a preparation made from a particular tree fungus that grew on birch trees in the northern forests. Hulda claimed this substance, when properly prepared and administered early in the disease progression, significantly reduced the severity of lung involvement—the aspect of the plague that most often proved fatal.

"We gather it only from living trees during the waning moon," she explained, showing Claudius a sample of the dried fungus. "It must be dried slowly near smoke but not in direct heat, then ground and steeped in hot water for precisely the time it takes to recite the healing prayer three times."

Claudius noted these details carefully, recognizing that while the prayer element reflected tribal spiritual beliefs, the specific preparation method likely preserved active medicinal properties in the fungus. Throughout his career, he had observed that effective traditional remedies often contained genuine pharmacological value, even when embedded in ritual or supernatural frameworks.

"How is it administered?" he asked, examining the sample with professional interest.

"The patient drinks the strained liquid three times daily, from the first appearance of fever until the purple marks fade or death comes," Hulda replied matter-of-factly. "It tastes bitter and causes some to vomit the first dose. They must be made to take it again immediately if this occurs."

Claudius nodded, making notes on a wax tablet. The practical administration details were as important as the preparation method—dosage, timing, and management of side effects all critical to effective treatment.

In exchange, he shared his own approaches to treating the plague—the cooling methods for managing fever, the herbal preparations that seemed to ease respiratory distress, the careful hydration protocols he had developed during the previous outbreak. He explained the containment measures implemented in the camp, the separation of the garrison into smaller units with minimal cross-contact, the enhanced sanitation protocols throughout all quarters.

Hulda listened attentively, occasionally asking clarifying questions that revealed her own sophisticated understanding of disease progression and treatment. Her apprentice, Frieda, remained largely silent but observed everything with keen attention, sometimes making her own notes using a system of symbols scratched onto a piece of smooth bark.

As the morning progressed, their exchange deepened from merely sharing specific treatments to discussing underlying principles of disease and healing. Despite vastly different cultural frameworks, Claudius found that he and Hulda shared fundamental approaches to medical practice—careful observation, pattern recognition, methodical testing of treatments, and adaptation based on results.

"Your people believe the sickness comes from bad air or imbalanced humors," Hulda observed, demonstrating awareness of Roman medical theory. "We believe it is carried by spirits that enter the body through breath. Different explanations, yet we both cover our faces when treating the afflicted, we both isolate the sick from the healthy, we both recognize that proximity increases risk."

"Different paths to the same practical wisdom," Claudius acknowledged. "Though I suspect neither explanation fully captures the disease's true nature."

This philosophical exchange was interrupted by the arrival of Demetrius, bringing word that a new case had been identified in the camp—a young legionary showing early symptoms of fever and respiratory distress, now isolated in the infirmary.

"An opportunity to demonstrate our methods in practice," Hulda suggested, gathering several of her preparations. "If you permit."

Claudius considered briefly before nodding agreement. While allowing a tribal healer to treat a Roman soldier was unprecedented, the potential benefit outweighed conventional restrictions—especially given the poor outcomes with standard treatments thus far.

They moved to the infirmary, where the new patient lay on a pallet in the isolation section, his face flushed with fever but not yet showing the purple spots that would appear in later stages. A young man, perhaps twenty, with the muscular build of a trained legionary but now weakened by the disease's initial assault.

Hulda approached without hesitation, her manner shifting from theoretical discussion to practical healing. She examined the patient with experienced hands—checking pulse at neck and wrist, placing her ear against his chest to listen to breathing, examining eyes and tongue for discoloration.

"Early stages," she confirmed. "The lung involvement has begun but remains limited. A good candidate for the birch fungus treatment."

With Claudius's permission, she prepared the remedy, demonstrating the precise method of measuring, steeping, and straining the fungus preparation. The resulting liquid was dark and bitter-smelling, causing the patient to grimace when it was brought to his lips.

"He must drink it all," Hulda instructed firmly. "And again at midday and sunset. For seven days or until the fever breaks completely."

The young legionary looked to Claudius for confirmation, understandably hesitant to consume medicine prepared by a tribal healer. At the physician's nod, he drank the bitter liquid, managing to keep it down despite evident distaste.

Hulda then demonstrated other elements of her treatment approach—a poultice of specific herbs applied to the chest to ease breathing, a method of controlled cooling using cloths soaked in water infused with mint and other herbs, precise positioning to facilitate drainage from the lungs.

Throughout, she explained each step to Claudius and his assistants, ensuring the knowledge could be replicated after her departure. The practical demonstration added crucial details that might have been missed in theoretical discussion alone—the exact consistency of preparations, the specific placement of poultices, the timing of various interventions.

"These methods will not save all," she cautioned as they completed the treatment. "The very young, the elderly, those already weakened by other conditions—many will still succumb despite our best efforts. But for those with strength to fight the sickness, these approaches may tip the balance toward survival."

Claudius nodded, understanding both the potential and the limitations of what he had learned. No medical intervention was perfect, especially against a disease as virulent as the plague. But even modest improvements in survival rates would save significant numbers given the scale of the outbreak.

They returned to the exchange building, where the discussion continued through midday and into the afternoon. Claudius shared his observations from the previous plague outbreak—patterns of spread, variations in symptoms among different populations, long-term effects in survivors. Hulda described how the disease had moved through tribal territories, forcing abandonment of contaminated villages and contributing to the population movements that Roman scouts had observed.

"The sickness recognizes no boundaries between our peoples," she noted as their exchange neared its conclusion. "Perhaps in fighting it together, we find common ground that war would destroy."

It was a philosophical observation that Claudius found himself appreciating, despite his usual focus on practical rather than theoretical matters. The plague indeed created a shared enemy that transcended the traditional hostilities between Rome and the tribes—an invisible foe that killed indiscriminately on both sides of the frontier.

As evening approached, Hulda and Frieda prepared to depart, having fulfilled their mission to share healing knowledge. They left substantial quantities of their medicinal preparations, including the precious birch fungus, with detailed instructions for their use. In exchange, Claudius provided several of his own remedies that had shown promise in treating the plague's symptoms, along with a small surgical kit that Hulda had admired during their discussions.

"We will return in seven days to check on the patient and bring more of the fungus preparation," Hulda said as they gathered their belongings. "By then, you will have seen whether our methods prove effective in Roman bodies as they have among our people."

Claudius accompanied them to the north gate, where an escort waited to guide them safely back to the river crossing. The brief winter day was already fading toward dusk, the temperature dropping sharply as shadows lengthened across the snow-covered landscape.

"Your knowledge may save many lives on both sides of the river," he told Hulda as they prepared to depart. "That creates a debt that transcends the usual relations between our peoples."

The tribal healer considered this statement thoughtfully before responding. "Knowledge freely shared creates no debt," she replied. "It honors the wisdom of our ancestors, who understood that healing belongs to no single tribe or nation. The plants and fungi offer their medicine to all who learn their secrets, not only to those who claim certain territories as their own."

With that philosophical perspective—one that Claudius found surprisingly aligned with his own views on medical knowledge—the tribal healers departed, their figures gradually disappearing into the gathering dusk as they made their way toward the frozen Danube.

Claudius returned to the infirmary, his mind already organizing and analyzing the new information he had gained. The exchange had been more valuable than he had anticipated, providing not merely specific remedies but insights into different approaches to understanding and treating disease.

He checked on the young legionary who had received Hulda's treatment, finding him resting more comfortably than most plague patients at a similar stage of the disease. The fever remained but seemed less intense, and the breathing difficulties had not progressed as rapidly as typically observed. Whether this represented the treatment's effectiveness or merely variation in the disease's natural progression remained to be determined, but it offered a glimmer of hope.

As he continued his evening rounds, Claudius found himself reflecting on the day's unusual events. The exchange with the tribal healers represented something rare in frontier relations—cooperation based on shared humanity rather than political or military necessity. While Titus and Arminius negotiated the complex diplomatic and strategic dimensions of the frontier situation, he and Hulda had found immediate common ground in their commitment to healing regardless of which side of the river their patients called home.

There was a lesson in this, perhaps, though Claudius was typically more concerned with practical medicine than philosophical implications. The boundaries that humans created—between territories, between peoples, between systems of knowledge—often impeded understanding that might benefit all. Disease recognized no such boundaries, spreading wherever conditions allowed. Perhaps healing should follow the same principle, moving freely across the artificial divisions that separated people who shared the same fundamental vulnerabilities.

These reflections were interrupted by the arrival of Titus, who had come to the infirmary specifically to learn the outcomes of the exchange with the tribal healers. The prefect looked tired but focused, the weight of command evident in his bearing despite his efforts to maintain an appearance of unwavering strength.

"The meeting was productive?" he asked without preamble.

"Remarkably so," Claudius confirmed. "Their knowledge of treating the plague is sophisticated and practical, developed through extensive experience with the disease among their people. Several of their approaches seem promising, particularly a preparation made from a specific forest fungus that appears to reduce lung involvement."

"You've implemented these treatments already?"

"For one patient thus far, recently admitted with early symptoms. The tribal healer demonstrated her methods directly, ensuring we understood the precise preparation and administration. It's too soon to determine effectiveness, but initial signs are encouraging."

Titus nodded, satisfied with this assessment. "And your impression of the healers themselves?"

"Professional, knowledgeable, and surprisingly open to exchanging information rather than merely providing it," Claudius replied. "The elder, Hulda, has clearly spent decades developing her healing practice. Her understanding of disease progression and treatment principles would be respected even among trained physicians in Rome."

This evaluation seemed to please Titus, confirming his decision to accept Arminius's offer of medical exchange. "They'll return?"

"In seven days, to check the patient's progress and bring additional medicinal preparations. They've left sufficient quantities for immediate needs, with detailed instructions for their use."

"Good." Titus glanced toward the isolation section where the plague patients were housed. "Any change in the overall outbreak situation?"

"Containment measures continue to be effective," Claudius reported. "No new cases in the past three days except the young legionary who received the tribal treatment today. Those already infected follow the expected progression—some improving, others deteriorating despite our best efforts."

The physician hesitated before adding, "If the tribal remedies prove effective, particularly the fungus preparation, we may see improved recovery rates. But implementation will require gathering or obtaining significant quantities of specific materials that grow primarily in the northern forests."

"Another potential area for cooperation," Titus noted thoughtfully. "Medicinal supplies exchanged or traded rather than merely knowledge."

"Precisely. Though such arrangements would require broader authorization than our current limited exchange."

Titus nodded understanding. The medical cooperation, like the diplomatic engagement with Arminius, represented a departure from traditional frontier relations that would require imperial approval for any significant expansion.

"Document everything thoroughly," he instructed. "Both the specific treatments and your assessment of their effectiveness. I'll include this information in my dispatch to the Emperor regarding the broader frontier situation."

After Titus had departed, Claudius returned to the small building where the knowledge exchange had taken place. The table still held samples of both Roman and tribal medicines, physical representations of the different healing traditions that had been shared that day.

He began the detailed documentation that Titus had requested, recording not only the specific remedies and their preparation but the underlying principles that Hulda had explained. This information would be valuable not merely for the current outbreak but for future occurrences of the plague, which history suggested would eventually return despite all preventive efforts.

As he worked, Claudius found himself appreciating the unexpected opportunity that had emerged from the frontier crisis. Throughout his career, he had sought medical knowledge wherever it might be found—studying with physicians from Greece, Egypt, and Syria, examining healing practices from diverse cultures throughout the empire. Yet he had never anticipated learning valuable approaches from tribal healers beyond the northern frontier, people typically dismissed by Romans as primitive and superstitious.

The experience reinforced a principle he had long believed but sometimes forgotten in the structured environment of Roman medicine—that effective healing knowledge could develop in any culture that observed carefully and tested methodically, regardless of its technological advancement or philosophical framework. The tribal healers lacked the extensive written tradition and theoretical structures of Roman medicine, but their practical experience with the plague had led them to effective approaches that imperial physicians had not discovered despite their more formal training.

There was humility in this realization, a reminder that no single medical tradition—not even one as advanced as Rome's—held all answers to the complex challenges of disease and healing. Progress came through exchange and integration, through willingness to learn from different approaches rather than dismissing them based on their origin.

Claudius completed his documentation late into the night, creating a comprehensive record of what he had learned from Hulda and Frieda. Tomorrow he would begin implementing their methods more broadly among the plague patients, carefully observing and recording outcomes to determine which approaches proved most effective in their particular circumstances.

The exchange represented a small point of light in the otherwise dark situation of plague and potential conflict—a reminder that cooperation remained possible even between peoples typically separated by hostility and misunderstanding. Whether this cooperation would extend beyond medical matters to the broader diplomatic and strategic questions facing the frontier remained to be seen. But for Claudius, focused on saving lives regardless of which side of the river they called home, today's exchange offered both practical hope and philosophical reassurance that common ground could be found when fundamental human needs transcended political divisions.

---

The following days brought cautious optimism regarding both the medical exchange and the broader frontier situation. The young legionary who had received Hulda's treatment showed remarkable improvement—fever breaking on the fourth day, respiratory symptoms steadily diminishing, the dreaded purple spots appearing only minimally before fading without spreading across his body.

Encouraged by this outcome, Claudius implemented the tribal remedies for other plague patients, carefully following Hulda's instructions regarding preparation and administration. Results varied, as expected—some patients showing similar improvement, others progressing to more severe stages despite treatment. But overall, the survival rate appeared to be improving compared to previous patterns, particularly among younger, stronger patients treated early in the disease progression.

The birch fungus preparation proved especially valuable, its effect on reducing lung involvement noticeable in multiple cases. Claudius began training his assistants in recognizing the specific fungus from samples Hulda had provided, though gathering new supplies would require either cooperation with the tribes or expeditions into the northern forests once weather permitted.

Beyond the infirmary, the diplomatic process initiated by the meeting between Titus and Arminius continued to develop. Imperial couriers traveled between Carnuntum and Sirmium despite winter conditions, carrying detailed reports and directives as Marcus Aurelius considered the unprecedented proposal for temporary tribal settlement south of the river.

Titus maintained regular communication with Arminius through messengers exchanged at the river crossing, each side providing updates on their respective situations while the imperial decision remained pending. The tribal leader reported continuing pressure from northern populations but confirmed that the gathered forces remained under control, with no unauthorized movements toward the frontier.

Within Carnuntum, the plague containment measures remained in effect, though modified slightly based on improved understanding of the disease's transmission patterns. The camp continued to function at reduced but adequate efficiency, maintaining essential operations while limiting potential spread of contagion between units.

Seven days after their initial visit, Hulda and Frieda returned as promised, again arriving at dawn at the north gate. This time they were received with noticeably less suspicion by the sentries, their status as healers now recognized and respected throughout the camp following the positive outcomes of their previous visit.

Claudius welcomed them warmly, eager to share the results of implementing their treatments and to discuss refinements based on observations of specific cases. They proceeded directly to the infirmary, where the young legionary who had first received the tribal remedies was now sitting up on his pallet, still weakened but clearly recovering—a dramatic contrast to the typical progression of plague cases at a similar stage.

"The fungus medicine has worked well in this one," Hulda observed with professional satisfaction rather than surprise. "His life-force was strong to begin with, and the treatment began before the sickness took deep root in his lungs."

She examined the patient thoroughly, checking pulse and breathing, examining the fading spots on his skin, testing his strength with simple movement exercises. Her apprentice, Frieda, observed carefully, occasionally making notes on her bark tablet using the symbolic writing system they had demonstrated during their previous visit.

"He will recover fully," Hulda concluded. "Though strength will return slowly, over many weeks. The sickness leaves shadows in the body even after its visible signs have disappeared."

This aligned with Claudius's own observations of plague survivors from the previous outbreak—many experiencing lingering weakness, breathing difficulties, or other symptoms for months after apparent recovery. He had documented these long-term effects extensively, noting patterns that might help identify which patients required continued care beyond the acute phase of the disease.

They proceeded to examine other patients who had received the tribal treatments, Hulda offering adjustments to dosages or application methods based on individual responses. For some, she recommended increased quantities of the fungus preparation; for others, different combinations of the herbal poultices used to ease breathing difficulties.

Throughout, she explained her reasoning to Claudius and his assistants, ensuring they understood not merely what to do but why—the principles behind the specific interventions that would allow them to adapt treatments to new situations even without her direct guidance.

"The body speaks through its responses," she explained as they discussed a particularly challenging case. "The healer must listen and adjust, not merely follow fixed patterns of treatment. What serves one patient may harm another, depending on their particular balance of strengths and weaknesses."

This philosophy of individualized treatment based on careful observation aligned closely with Claudius's own approach, despite the vastly different cultural frameworks in which they had developed their healing practices. Again, he found himself appreciating the unexpected common ground between Roman and tribal medicine at the level of practical application, even when theoretical explanations diverged significantly.

After completing their rounds of the plague patients, they returned to the exchange building for further discussion of treatment refinements and longer-term management of the outbreak. Hulda had brought additional supplies of the birch fungus and other medicinal materials, ensuring Claudius could continue the treatments until their next visit.

"Your people have implemented our methods well," she observed. "The results show in the patients' conditions. More survive than would have without these treatments, though the sickness still claims those too weak to fight it even with our help."

"Your knowledge has proven invaluable," Claudius acknowledged. "Particularly the fungus preparation, which addresses the lung involvement more effectively than any remedy we had previously developed."

Hulda nodded, accepting the acknowledgment without false modesty. "It was discovered three generations ago by my grandmother's grandmother, during an earlier visitation of a similar sickness. Many died before she found the right combination of fungus, preparation method, and dosage. Her knowledge was preserved through our healing traditions, passed from teacher to apprentice through the years."

This oral transmission of medical knowledge contrasted with the written tradition that Claudius had trained within, where texts by Hippocrates, Galen, and other physicians formed the foundation of practice, supplemented by personal experience and observation. Yet the tribal approach had clearly preserved effective treatments across generations, adapting them to new challenges as they arose.

Their discussion expanded to include broader aspects of managing the outbreak—not merely treating individual cases but preventing spread, supporting recovery in survivors, and maintaining community health during the extended crisis. Hulda described methods her people had developed for purifying air in enclosed spaces during winter, for strengthening resistance through specific foods and preparations, for supporting the body's recovery after severe illness.

Claudius shared his own approaches to these challenges, including the containment protocols implemented throughout the camp, the nutritional guidelines he had established for both prevention and recovery, and the systematic documentation of cases that allowed identification of patterns and refinement of treatments.

As their exchange continued, Titus joined them briefly, having been informed of the tribal healers' return. He expressed formal appreciation for their contribution to addressing the outbreak within the Roman camp, acknowledging the lives that had likely been saved through their shared knowledge.

"Arminius sends greetings," Hulda told him. "And asks me to inform you that the situation beyond the river remains as discussed during your meeting. The gathered forces maintain their positions, awaiting word of the Emperor's decision regarding the settlement proposal."

Titus nodded, accepting this diplomatic communication delivered through the unusual channel of the healing exchange. "The Emperor's response is expected within days," he replied. "Imperial couriers travel between Sirmium and Carnuntum despite the winter conditions, recognizing the importance of timely decision in this matter."

After this brief diplomatic exchange, Titus departed, leaving the healers to continue their medical discussions without political considerations intruding more than necessary. The separation of these domains—medical cooperation proceeding regardless of diplomatic outcomes—had been an intentional decision, allowing the healing exchange to develop based on its own merits rather than being contingent on broader political agreements.

As evening approached, Hulda and Frieda prepared once again to depart, having completed another productive day of knowledge exchange. They arranged to return in ten days, by which time the effects of their treatments on the full range of patients would be more definitively established.

"The river ice grows thicker," Hulda noted as they gathered their belongings. "The crossing becomes easier each day, though the cold tests even those accustomed to winter conditions."

"Your willingness to make this journey despite the difficulties is appreciated," Claudius replied. "The knowledge you've shared may well determine survival for many within our camp."

Hulda paused, seeming to consider something before speaking again. "There is another matter I wished to discuss before departing," she said, her tone shifting slightly. "A possibility that extends beyond our current exchange."

Claudius indicated for her to continue, curious about this new direction.

"Among our people, healing knowledge is preserved through apprenticeship—direct transmission from experienced healer to chosen student over many years," Hulda explained. "Frieda has trained with me for seven winters and shows great promise, but there is value in exposure to different traditions and approaches."

She glanced at her apprentice before continuing. "If the broader situation between our peoples allows, I would propose that Frieda remain here for a time, learning your Roman methods while sharing more of our tribal approaches. A deeper exchange that might benefit both healing traditions."

The proposal was unexpected but intriguing—a significant extension of their current limited cooperation into something more substantial and potentially lasting. A tribal healer training within a Roman military camp represented a departure from traditional boundaries that would have been unthinkable before the current crisis created common ground through shared challenges.

"An interesting possibility," Claudius acknowledged, considering the practical and political implications. "Though it would require approval beyond my own authority, given the unprecedented nature of such an arrangement."

"Of course," Hulda nodded understanding. "I present it as a possibility to consider, not an immediate proposal. Perhaps something to discuss with your prefect as the broader situation develops."

"I will raise it with him," Claudius promised. "The value of our current exchange suggests that deeper cooperation might indeed benefit both our healing traditions."

With that understanding, they concluded their meeting, Claudius accompanying the tribal healers to the north gate as before. The winter evening had already descended into full darkness, torches illuminating the path as they made their way through the camp.

"Until ten days hence," Hulda said as they prepared to depart with their escort. "By then, the Emperor's decision regarding the settlement proposal will likely be known, shaping what becomes possible between our peoples in many domains, including healing."

After they had departed, Claudius returned to the infirmary to check on the patients once more before seeking his own rest. The young legionary who had first received the tribal treatment was sleeping peacefully, his breathing regular and unlabored—a marked contrast to the typical condition of plague victims at a similar stage of the disease.

Other patients showed varying degrees of improvement, some responding well to the tribal remedies while others continued to struggle despite all interventions. The pattern was becoming clearer with each passing day—younger, stronger patients treated early in the disease progression had the best outcomes, while those already weakened by age or previous conditions often succumbed despite the most diligent care.

Yet even this partial effectiveness represented significant progress compared to their previous approaches. Lives were being saved that would likely have been lost without the knowledge Hulda had shared, creating a debt of gratitude that transcended the usual relations between Roman and tribal peoples.

As he completed his rounds, Claudius found himself contemplating Hulda's proposal for deeper exchange through apprenticeship. The potential benefits were substantial—not merely for addressing the current outbreak but for developing integrated approaches to healing that drew from both traditions. Frieda would gain exposure to Roman medical knowledge and techniques, while the Roman physicians would have ongoing access to tribal healing wisdom that had proven its value in treating the plague.

Yet the political implications were complex, particularly given the uncertain outcome of the broader diplomatic process initiated by Titus and Arminius. A tribal healer living and working within a Roman military camp represented a level of integration that went beyond temporary cooperation during crisis. It would establish precedent that might influence frontier relations in domains extending well beyond medicine.

Claudius decided to raise the possibility with Titus the following day, presenting it as a natural extension of the successful medical exchange rather than a separate initiative. The prefect would understand both the potential benefits and the broader implications, positioning the proposal appropriately within his diplomatic communications with both Arminius and the Emperor.

For now, Claudius focused on documenting the day's developments—the condition of patients receiving tribal treatments, the refinements Hulda had suggested based on individual responses, the additional knowledge she had shared regarding long-term management of the outbreak. This systematic recording of information was central to his approach to medicine, ensuring that knowledge gained through current experience would be preserved for future application.

As he worked, his mind returned periodically to the unexpected common ground he had found with Hulda despite their vastly different backgrounds and training. Both had developed their healing practices through careful observation, methodical testing, and adaptation based on results. Both prioritized practical effectiveness over theoretical purity. Both recognized the individuality of patients and the need to adjust treatments accordingly.

These similarities suggested something fundamental about the nature of effective healing that transcended cultural boundaries—an empirical approach based on observation and results rather than fixed doctrine or tradition. Perhaps this shared foundation explained why their exchange had proven so immediately productive, despite the language barriers and different explanatory frameworks they employed.

Whatever diplomatic outcomes emerged from the broader frontier situation, this medical cooperation had already demonstrated the possibility of meaningful exchange across traditional boundaries. Lives had been saved on both sides of the river through shared knowledge, creating connections that might influence relations between Roman and tribal peoples long after the current crisis had passed.

With that hopeful reflection, Claudius completed his documentation and finally sought his own rest, knowing that tomorrow would bring new challenges in managing the outbreak but also new possibilities for cooperation that might extend beyond the immediate medical domain. The healing exchange had opened a door that neither side had anticipated when the frontier crisis began—a small but significant point of light in the otherwise dark winter of plague and potential conflict along the frozen Danube.
