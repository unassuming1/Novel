# Chapter 3: Beyond the River

The forest held its breath. Only the crunch of snow beneath their feet and occasional crack of ice-laden branches broke the silence. Valerius moved with the instinctive stealth of a frontier-born scout, his breath clouding briefly before vanishing in the frigid air. Three men from the Fourteenth Legion's scout detachment followed—Numerius, a weathered tracker from Hispania; Castor, a Gaul whose father had served in the auxiliaries; and young Flavius, a Roman who had never seen snow until his posting to the frontier two years ago.

They had crossed the Danube before dawn, using a narrow point where ice had formed thick enough to bear their weight, reinforced with fallen logs they had dragged into position. One misstep on that treacherous surface meant death in the frigid current. But Valerius had led them across safely, his knowledge of the river's moods proving as valuable as Prefect Gallus had predicted.

Several hours into Germanic territory, they moved through a landscape both familiar and strange to Valerius. He had hunted these forests in his youth, before joining the Roman auxiliaries. The terrain remained unchanged—the same rolling hills, mixture of pine and oak, frozen streams winding through small valleys. But the human presence had vanished. Scattered settlements that once dotted the region stood abandoned, their inhabitants gone without signs of violence or forced departure.

"Another one," Numerius murmured, pointing ahead to where a small village's remains were visible through the trees.

Valerius nodded, signaling for caution. Though they had encountered no one since crossing the river, he maintained discipline—silent movement, frequent stops to listen, careful observation. The four men wore heavy winter cloaks over simple tunics and trousers rather than military garb, carrying hunting bows and knives instead of Roman weapons. If discovered, they would claim to be traders seeking pelts, their story rehearsed down to the smallest detail.

The village consisted of a dozen simple structures—wooden longhouses with thatched roofs sagging under snow. A central fire pit, long cold, marked the communal gathering place. Animal pens stood empty, gates left open. Storage huts had been methodically emptied.

"Same as the others," Castor whispered as they moved between abandoned dwellings. "No fighting. No bodies. No burning. They just... left."

"Not in haste," Numerius added, examining a longhouse. "Everything secured. Roofs repaired before departure, doors closed against weather. Planned, not panicked."

Valerius knelt beside the central fire pit, brushing away snow to examine the ashes. "Cold for many days. But not since first snowfall. They left before winter fully set in."

"All of them?" Flavius asked, his voice betraying youth despite attempts at detachment. "Even the children and old ones? Where would they go with winter coming?"

"That," Valerius replied, "is what we're here to discover."

They searched thoroughly but quickly, seeking clues about the inhabitants' destination. Inside one longhouse, Valerius found scratched markings on a wooden post—symbols meaningless to his Roman companions but familiar from his childhood.

"The bear sign," he explained, tracing the crude carving. "Marks Arminius, a war chief of the Marcomanni. His clan's symbol."

"So this was a Marcomanni village?" Numerius asked.

Valerius shook his head. "Quadi territory. The Marcomanni live further west." He frowned. "For their mark to be here means either they've expanded into Quadi lands, or..."

"Or the tribes are gathering under Marcomanni leadership," Numerius finished.

"We need to keep moving," Valerius decided, standing. "There's a larger settlement two hours north—or was when I last hunted here. If it's also abandoned, it will tell us more."

They left the empty village as carefully as they had entered, leaving no trace. The short winter day was already waning, weak sun barely visible through clouds. Valerius set a pace balancing speed with stealth, aware they needed to gather information before returning to the river crossing by nightfall.

As they moved deeper into the forest, signs of human activity grew more frequent—trails widened by many feet, freshly cut trees, hunting blinds near game paths. Yet still they encountered no people, as if the entire region had been systematically emptied.

"Makes no sense," Castor muttered during a brief rest. "These are their hunting grounds. Winter stores would be gathered here. Why leave before the worst weather?"

"Unless they found better provisions elsewhere," Numerius suggested. "Or something more important than winter survival drives them."

Valerius said nothing, his expression troubled. Born in this frontier region to a Pannonian mother and a father who had served in the auxiliaries, he understood both Roman and tribal perspectives. What he saw matched neither normal patterns of tribal life nor typical preparations for conflict with Rome. Something unprecedented was happening beyond the frontier, something that had caused traditional enemies to cooperate and entire communities to relocate despite approaching winter.

They reached the larger settlement as afternoon shadows lengthened. Unlike the small village examined earlier, this had been a substantial community—dozens of structures around a central meeting ground, with specialized buildings for metalworking, leather tanning, and food storage. A wooden palisade surrounded it, though more symbolic than defensive, with wide gates standing open on north and south sides.

Like the smaller village, it stood completely abandoned.

"Spread out," Valerius instructed. "Same search pattern. Look for any signs of where they went or why. Meet back here when the sun touches the western trees."

The four scouts separated, each taking a section to examine. Valerius headed for the largest structure—a longhouse nearly three times the size of others, likely the dwelling of the settlement's chief or council meeting place. Its entrance was decorated with carved wooden totems representing tribal spirits and ancestors, their features weathered but distinct.

Inside, the longhouse was dark and cold, but Valerius's eyes quickly adjusted to dim light filtering through smoke holes in the roof. The central fire pit contained only ashes, but the interior showed the same signs of deliberate preparation—possessions carefully stored or taken, sleeping platforms cleared of furs, food containers emptied.

What caught his attention was the far wall. There, painted in ochre and charcoal on stretched deerhide, hung a crude map. It depicted the Danube as a winding line, with symbols representing Roman fortifications along its southern bank. North of the river, various tribal territories were marked with their traditional symbols—eagle for Quadi, wolf for Iazyges, bear for Marcomanni.

But something had been added recently. Fresh charcoal lines connected the tribal symbols, converging at a point well north of the river. From that convergence, multiple arrows pointed south toward the Danube, concentrated particularly at the section opposite Carnuntum.

Valerius studied the map intently, committing details to memory. This was exactly the intelligence Gallus had sent them to find—concrete evidence of coordination among tribes, with apparent plans for multiple river crossings focused on a specific section of frontier.

He was so absorbed that he almost missed the sound—soft leather scraping against wood from the entrance. Valerius froze, hand moving instinctively to his knife. Then, forcing casualness, he turned as if merely continuing his examination.

A figure stood in the doorway, silhouetted against gray winter light. Tall and broad-shouldered, wearing furs and leather, with a long knife at his belt and unstrung bow across his back. Unmistakably Germanic, with long hair braided at the temples and a beard adorned with small metal beads that clinked softly as he tilted his head.

For a long moment, neither man moved. Valerius's mind raced through options—fight, flee, or maintain his trader cover. The last seemed least viable given that he'd been caught examining a war map.

"You are far from the river, Roman," the Germanic man said in heavily accented but understandable Latin.

The trader pretense evaporated. Valerius remained outwardly calm despite his quickening pulse. "As are you, from your empty villages," he replied in the Quadi dialect of his childhood.

The man's eyebrows rose slightly at hearing his own language. He stepped fully into the longhouse, allowing Valerius to see him clearly. He was younger than his bearing suggested, perhaps late twenties, with a recent scar along his jawline and eyes hardened by violence.

"You speak as one of us," the Germanic warrior observed, switching to Quadi. "Yet you move with Roman scouts and examine our war council's map. What are you?"

"A man of both worlds," Valerius answered truthfully, seeing little point in elaborate lies. "Born here, but serving Rome."

"A traitor, then."

"A survivor," Valerius countered. "As all who live on the frontier must be."

The warrior seemed to consider this, hand resting on his knife hilt but making no move to draw. "You crossed the frozen river," he stated rather than asked. "Dangerous this season. Your Roman masters must value whatever you might tell them."

Valerius remained silent, calculating his chances if violence erupted. The Germanic warrior was younger and larger, but Valerius had position and experience. A knife fight in the confined longhouse would likely end badly for both.

"Your companions are being watched," the warrior continued conversationally. "Three others, moving through our empty home like ghosts, thinking themselves unseen. My hunting party has them in sight, awaiting my signal."

Truth or bluff, Valerius couldn't tell. But the situation had deteriorated beyond hope of simple escape. He needed information while staying alive long enough for potential extraction.

"If you meant to kill us, we'd already be dead," Valerius observed. "So you want something else."

A smile flickered across the bearded face. "Perceptive. Yes, I want something." He gestured to the wall map. "I want you to deliver a message to your Prefect Gallus."

Valerius concealed his surprise at hearing Titus's name and rank. The tribes having specific knowledge of frontier command was concerning.

"What message?"

The warrior stepped closer, voice dropping though no one else could hear. "Tell him that what comes is not what he thinks. Tell him that the gathering beyond the river is not merely for war, though war may come. Tell him that Arminius of the Bear Clan would speak with him before blood is shed unnecessarily."

Valerius kept his expression neutral despite his shock. "Arminius. The war chief himself."

The warrior—Arminius—inclined his head slightly. "The same."

"Why would a war chief wish to speak with a Roman prefect? Especially while gathering forces for what appears to be an attack?" Valerius nodded toward the map.

"Because what appears to be is not always what is," Arminius replied. "And because I have seen enough death to know its value—and its cost."

A shout from outside interrupted them—Numerius's voice, raised in alarm. Arminius's head turned toward the sound, then back to Valerius, his expression hardening.

"Your companions have been discovered. Less patient hunters than myself." He drew his knife—a long, single-edged blade of pattern-welded steel. "Now we must decide quickly, man of both worlds. Do we fight as enemies, or do you carry my message?"

Valerius measured the distance between them, the confines of the longhouse, the sounds of commotion growing outside. Fighting meant likely death—if not by this warrior's hand, then by his hunting party. And even if he somehow prevailed, the intelligence about tribal coordination would die with him.

"I'll carry your message," he decided. "But words alone won't convince a Roman prefect. He'll need more."

Arminius studied him for a moment, then reached to his neck and removed a pendant—a small bronze bear, intricately detailed, hanging from a leather cord. "My token. Gallus will know it came from me and no other."

"How would a Roman prefect recognize your personal token?"

A smile touched Arminius's lips. "Because I showed it to him three winters ago, when we met during the truce talks at the river bend. Before the plague. Before all this." He gestured vaguely at the map and the abandoned settlement beyond the longhouse walls.

This was news to Valerius—that Gallus had personal history with the Marcomanni war chief. It added layers to an already complex situation.

"The message—when and where would this meeting take place?"

"Three days from now. At midday. The frozen bend where the river curves north, two miles downstream from your camp. Gallus will know it." Arminius's expression grew severe. "He should come with no more than five men. I will do the same. Any sign of treachery, and what follows will make your frontier wars seem like children's games."

More shouting outside, closer now. Arminius glanced toward the entrance. "Your companions fight well, but they are outnumbered. You must go—now." He pointed to the back of the longhouse. "There is another exit, behind the sleeping platforms. It leads to a path through the northern woods. Follow it until you reach the old hunting camp, then turn east toward the river."

"Why help us escape?" Valerius asked, suspicion warring with pragmatism.

"Because dead men carry no messages," Arminius replied simply. "And because I meant what I said—enough blood has been spilled already."

The sounds of fighting grew louder. Valerius made his decision, tucking the bronze bear pendant inside his tunic. "If this is a trap..."

"Then you die, as you might die today regardless," Arminius finished for him. "But if it is not a trap, perhaps others need not die tomorrow."

With that, the war chief turned and strode toward the longhouse entrance, shouting commands in the Marcomanni dialect. Valerius heard the fighting outside pause as Arminius emerged, his voice carrying authority that even the Roman scouts seemed to recognize.

Not waiting to see what would follow, Valerius moved quickly to the rear of the longhouse, finding the concealed exit Arminius had mentioned. It was narrow—little more than a gap between wall sections, hidden behind hanging furs that served as windbreaks for the sleeping platforms. He squeezed through, emerging into a small clearing behind the settlement.

From there, he could see part of the central area where his three companions stood surrounded by Germanic warriors—at least eight of them, armed with spears and bows. Arminius was addressing them, his words indistinct at this distance but his commanding presence unmistakable.

Valerius hesitated, torn between duty to his men and duty to the mission. The intelligence he carried—both the observed tribal coordination and Arminius's unexpected peace overture—was too valuable to risk. Yet abandoning his companions went against everything his Roman training had instilled.

As he watched, Arminius gestured toward the forest to the south, then said something that caused his warriors to lower their weapons. The three Roman scouts, though clearly tense, were not being treated as prisoners. It appeared Arminius was allowing them to leave as well.

Relief flooded through Valerius, followed immediately by suspicion. Why would a war chief preparing for conflict allow enemy scouts to return with information about his forces and positions? Either Arminius was supremely confident in his plans, or there was more to the situation than appeared on the surface.

Either way, Valerius knew his path forward. He needed to reach the river before nightfall, reunite with his companions if possible, and return to Carnuntum with both the intelligence he had gathered and Arminius's unexpected proposal.

He turned and moved into the forest, following the path Arminius had indicated. The snow had stopped falling, but the clouds remained heavy overhead, promising more before nightfall. The temperature was dropping as afternoon waned, the cold seeping through his layers of wool and fur.

The path was narrow but clear, winding through dense pine forest that provided some shelter from the wind. Valerius moved quickly but cautiously, alert for any sign that Arminius's apparent mercy had been a ruse. Yet he encountered no one—the forest remained as eerily empty as the abandoned settlements.

After nearly an hour of steady travel, he reached what must have been the hunting camp Arminius had mentioned—a small clearing with the remains of old fire pits and simple lean-to shelters. From there, he turned east as instructed, using the weak winter sun filtering through clouds to maintain his direction.

The terrain grew more difficult as he approached the river valley—steeper slopes, denser underbrush, patches of ice hidden beneath the snow. Valerius picked his way carefully, aware that injury alone in this wilderness would mean certain death. The bronze bear pendant pressed against his chest beneath his tunic, a constant reminder of his unexpected encounter and the message he carried.

As the light began to fade, he finally caught sight of the river through the trees—a broad, gray expanse partially covered with ice floes. He had emerged further downstream than their morning crossing point, which meant a difficult trek along the bank to reach their planned extraction site.

Valerius paused at the forest edge, studying the open ground between the trees and the riverbank. No sign of his companions, but also no sign of pursuit or ambush. Still, caution had kept him alive through fifteen years of frontier service. He waited, watching for any movement that didn't belong to wind or wildlife.

When he was satisfied, he moved quickly across the exposed ground to the riverbank. The Danube stretched before him, its far shore barely visible in the gathering dusk. Home—or what passed for home after so many years on the frontier. Carnuntum with its wooden palisades and stone headquarters, its familiar routines and faces. And Prefect Gallus, who would need to decide what to make of both the observed tribal movements and Arminius's unexpected peace overture.

Valerius turned north, following the riverbank toward their designated crossing point. The footing was treacherous—rocks and driftwood hidden beneath snow, patches of ice extending from the shore. He moved carefully but steadily, knowing that darkness would make the river crossing even more dangerous than it had been at dawn.

He had covered perhaps half the distance when he heard voices ahead—Latin, spoken in the distinctive accent of the Fourteenth Legion. Relief washed through him as he recognized Numerius's deep baritone and Castor's quicker speech. They had made it back to the crossing point.

"Hold!" called a voice as Valerius approached. "Identify yourself!"

"Valerius Rufus, scout auxiliary," he replied, using his full Roman name rather than the single name he typically went by. "Is that you, Numerius?"

A figure emerged from behind a fallen tree that provided some shelter from the wind. "Valerius! We thought you captured or killed."

The two men clasped forearms in greeting, genuine relief in Numerius's weathered face. "Castor and Flavius?"

"Here," Numerius confirmed. "Shaken but unharmed. The barbarians surrounded us, but their leader—a big one with a beaded beard—ordered them to let us go. Said something about enough blood being spilled already." He studied Valerius with sudden suspicion. "How did you escape?"

"The same leader," Valerius replied carefully. "He had me cornered in the longhouse but provided an escape route. I'll explain everything once we're across."

Numerius looked like he wanted to press further, but practicality won out. "The ice is holding, but barely. Temperature's dropping, which helps, but we should cross while there's still some light."

They rejoined Castor and Flavius, who had been preparing for the crossing by securing their weapons and equipment. Brief greetings were exchanged, but all four men understood that questions and explanations would wait until they reached the safety of the southern shore.

The crossing proved even more treacherous than that morning. The fading light made it difficult to judge which ice patches would bear their weight, and the temperature drop had created new thin ice that looked deceptively solid. They moved in single file, testing each step, using fallen branches to distribute their weight when necessary.

Halfway across, Flavius's foot broke through a thin patch, plunging into the frigid water up to his knee. The young scout gasped but managed not to cry out, his face contorting with the shock of cold. Valerius and Castor quickly pulled him up, supporting him between them as they continued the crossing. By the time they reached the southern shore, Flavius was limping badly, his soaked leg beginning to stiffen in the freezing air.

"We need to get him warm," Castor said, concern evident in his voice. "Frostbite will take his foot if we don't."

"There's a woodcutter's hut half a mile inland," Valerius recalled. "We can build a fire there without being seen from across the river."

They made their way through the gathering darkness, supporting Flavius between them. The young scout tried to maintain his composure, but his teeth chattered uncontrollably, and his steps grew increasingly uncoordinated as the cold penetrated deeper.

The woodcutter's hut was little more than a crude shelter—three walls and a roof, open to the south to allow for work in all but the worst weather. But it contained a stone-ringed fire pit and a stack of split logs left by the legionaries who maintained it as an observation post. Within minutes, they had a small fire burning, carefully shielded to prevent its light from being visible from the northern shore.

Flavius's boot and sock were removed, revealing a foot already pale with cold. Numerius, who had seen more than his share of frontier winters, took charge of the situation, instructing the others to massage the foot gently while he prepared a poultice of pine needles and melted snow—an old legionary remedy for cold injuries.

Only when Flavius was tended to and showing signs of improvement did the questions begin.

"What happened in that settlement?" Numerius asked Valerius. "Who was that barbarian leader, and why did he let us go?"

Valerius hesitated, weighing how much to reveal. These were trusted comrades, but Arminius's message was meant for Gallus alone. Still, they had shared the danger of the mission and deserved some explanation.

"His name is Arminius," Valerius said finally. "War chief of the Marcomanni Bear Clan. And he let us go because he wants to talk."

"Talk?" Castor scoffed. "Barbarians don't cross the frozen river to talk. They cross to raid and kill."

"Perhaps," Valerius acknowledged. "But there's more happening here than we understood. The abandoned villages, the tribal coordination... it's not just war preparation. Something else drives them."

"What?" Numerius asked.

Valerius shook his head. "I'm not certain. But Arminius claims he wants to meet with Prefect Gallus before any blood is shed. He gave me a token and a message to deliver."

He didn't mention the bronze bear pendant, keeping that detail for Gallus alone. The fewer who knew about it, the less chance of the information spreading through camp before the prefect could decide how to respond.

"And you believe him?" Castor asked incredulously. "A barbarian war chief?"

"I believe he could have killed us all and didn't," Valerius replied simply. "Beyond that, it's for the prefect to decide."

They fell silent, each man contemplating the implications of the day's discoveries. The fire crackled softly, its warmth a small comfort against the winter night and the uncertainties that lay ahead.

After Flavius had recovered enough to travel, they doused the fire and continued toward Carnuntum. The night was clear and bitterly cold, stars emerging as the clouds dispersed. Their breath formed clouds in the frigid air as they marched in silence, each lost in his own thoughts.

Valerius's hand occasionally strayed to his chest, feeling the outline of the bronze bear pendant beneath his tunic. Whatever Arminius's true intentions, the war chief had entrusted him with a message that could prevent bloodshed—or lead to an even greater trap than any straightforward attack. The responsibility weighed heavily as they approached the distant torches of Carnuntum's walls.

The sentry challenge came as they neared the western gate—a welcome return to familiar military routine after the uncertainties beyond the river.

"Advance and be recognized!"

"Valerius Rufus, scout auxiliary, returning with patrol," he called back, using the day's recognition phrase. "We bring word for the prefect's ears alone."

The gate opened just enough to admit them, closing quickly behind to preserve the camp's warmth. The duty officer, a young optio named Sergius, greeted them with evident relief.

"The prefect's been waiting for your return," he informed them. "He's in the principia with the senior tribune."

"Flavius needs attention first," Valerius said, indicating the young scout who was still limping despite the improvised treatment. "Cold water injury to his right foot."

Sergius nodded, calling for one of the legionaries to escort Flavius to the camp surgeon. "The rest of you are to report immediately. The prefect was most explicit about being informed the moment you returned, regardless of the hour."

Valerius exchanged glances with Numerius and Castor. Such urgency suggested developments on the Roman side of the river as well—perhaps additional intelligence from other outposts that complemented what they had discovered.

"We'll clean up and report at once," Valerius assured the optio.

"No time," Sergius replied. "The prefect said immediately, regardless of condition. Something's happening, though he hasn't shared what with the likes of me."

With that ominous statement hanging in the air, the three scouts followed Sergius through the camp toward the principia. The central headquarters building was fully illuminated despite the late hour, with messengers coming and going and the usual guards doubled at the entrance.

Inside, they found Prefect Gallus bent over the large map table, deep in conversation with Senior Tribune Quintus Varro and Centurion Decimus. All three men looked up as the scouts entered, their expressions a mixture of relief and tension.

"Report," Gallus ordered without preamble.

Valerius stepped forward, aware of the dried mud on his boots and the forest scents still clinging to his clothing. "Sir, we crossed as planned before dawn and investigated the abandoned settlements north of the river. We found evidence of coordinated tribal movement, centered on Marcomanni leadership."

He described the empty villages, the bear symbol, and the map showing tribal territories converging. Gallus listened intently, occasionally asking for clarification but otherwise allowing Valerius to deliver a complete account.

Only when he had finished the factual observations did Valerius hesitate, glancing at Numerius and Castor, then at the other officers present. Some messages were not meant for all ears.

Gallus, perceptive as always, caught the hesitation. "Is there more, Valerius?"

"Yes, Prefect. Something for your ears alone."

Gallus studied him for a moment, then nodded. "Decimus, see that these men get food and warm wine. Varro, review the maps based on their observations and adjust our patrol schedules accordingly. Valerius will join you shortly."

When the room had cleared, Gallus gestured for Valerius to approach the map table. "Now, what couldn't be said in front of the others?"

Valerius reached into his tunic and withdrew the bronze bear pendant, placing it on the map. "I encountered Arminius himself, the Marcomanni war chief. He let us go deliberately so I could bring you this token and a message."

Gallus's expression remained neutral, but Valerius noted the slight tensing of his shoulders at the mention of Arminius's name. He picked up the pendant, examining it with recognition.

"And the message?" he asked quietly.

"He requests a meeting. Three days from now, midday, at the frozen river bend two miles downstream. Five men maximum on each side." Valerius paused, then added, "He said that what comes is not what you think, that the gathering is not merely for war, and that he wishes to speak before blood is shed unnecessarily."

Gallus was silent for a long moment, turning the bronze bear over in his fingers. When he finally spoke, his voice was thoughtful. "Did he say anything else? Anything about why now, after all this time?"

"Only that he has seen enough death to know its value—and its cost."

The prefect nodded slowly, as if this confirmed something he had already suspected. "And you believe he was sincere?"

Valerius considered the question carefully. "He had every opportunity to kill or capture us. Instead, he provided an escape route and allowed my companions to leave unharmed. That suggests sincerity, or at least a purpose beyond simple deception."

"Or a more elaborate trap," Gallus noted.

"Possible," Valerius acknowledged. "But my instinct says otherwise. There was something in his manner—a weariness beneath the strength. Not what I would expect from a war chief preparing for a triumphant attack."

Gallus set the pendant down on the map, precisely at the river bend where the meeting was proposed. "Instincts matter on the frontier. Yours have proven reliable in the past." He looked up, his expression grave. "What you've reported changes things, Valerius. But how it changes them remains to be seen."

"Will you meet with him, Prefect?"

"That decision requires careful consideration." Gallus straightened, his commander's mask firmly back in place. "Get some food and rest. Report back at dawn—I'll have additional questions once I've had time to think through the implications."

Valerius saluted and turned to leave, but Gallus's voice stopped him at the door.

"Valerius. The bronze bear and Arminius's message remain between us for now. Understood?"

"Yes, Prefect."

"Good. Because if word spreads that I'm considering meeting with a barbarian war chief while his forces gather beyond the river, half my officers would think me mad and the other half would suspect treason."

Valerius nodded his understanding. The frontier was a place of rigid boundaries—not just the physical line of the river, but the conceptual division between Roman and barbarian, civilization and wilderness, order and chaos. The possibility of dialogue across that boundary was something few on either side could easily accept.

As he left the principia and made his way toward the mess hall where his companions waited, Valerius felt the weight of the day's discoveries. Whatever Arminius's true intentions, whatever Gallus decided about the proposed meeting, the situation along the frontier had grown more complex than a simple matter of defense against barbarian aggression.

And complexity, on the frontier, usually meant danger—not just from enemies who might attack, but from the uncertainty that made it difficult to distinguish friend from foe, threat from opportunity, wisdom from folly.

The torches of Carnuntum burned against the winter night, a small island of Roman order in a darkening world. But beyond the river, something was gathering that defied simple categorization. And three days from now, at a frozen river bend, two men from opposite sides of that boundary might meet to determine whether what followed would be war or something altogether unexpected.
