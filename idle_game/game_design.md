# The Silver Mines of Noricum: Idle Game Design Document

## Game Concept
"The Silver Mines of Noricum" is an idle game set in the Roman Empire during the Marcomannic Wars (circa 170-180 CE), running parallel to the events of "The Grass Crown" narrative. Players take on the role of a slave working in a silver mine in the province of Noricum, near the Danube frontier. As they labor in the mines, they hear news and rumors of the events unfolding along the frontier, including the exploits of Prefect Titus Aelius Gallus and the tribal conflicts beyond the Danube.

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Resource Collection**: Players automatically mine silver and other resources
2. **Resource Management**: Players allocate resources to survive, improve their conditions, and potentially gain freedom
3. **Narrative Progression**: As players reach milestones, they unlock story segments that reveal events from "The Grass Crown"
4. **Upgrades and Advancement**: Players can purchase upgrades to improve resource collection, unlock new areas, and advance their character's story

## Setting
The game is set in a Roman silver mine in Noricum, a province just south of the Danube frontier where the main events of "The Grass Crown" take place. The mine supplies silver for Roman coinage, which becomes increasingly important as the Empire faces challenges from tribal confederations and the aftermath of plague.

## Player Character
The player character is a slave from a tribal village beyond the Danube who was captured during a Roman raid and sent to work in the silver mines. They have knowledge of both Roman and tribal cultures, allowing them to understand the significance of news that reaches the mines.

## Resources
1. **Silver Ore**: The primary resource collected through mining
2. **Food**: Required for survival and energy
3. **Water**: Required for survival and energy
4. **Tools**: Improves mining efficiency
5. **Medicine**: Helps recover from illness and injuries
6. **Favor**: Represents goodwill from overseers and other slaves
7. **Knowledge**: Gained from conversations and observations, unlocks strategic options

## Game Mechanics

### Resource Collection
- **Automatic Mining**: Silver ore is collected automatically at a base rate
- **Click Mining**: Players can click to get small immediate resource boosts
- **Mining Shifts**: Different times of day affect mining rates and events
- **Mine Hazards**: Random events that can injure the player or damage tools

### Resource Management
- **Survival Needs**: Players must maintain minimum levels of food and water
- **Health Management**: Injuries and illness reduce efficiency and require medicine
- **Tool Maintenance**: Tools degrade over time and must be repaired or replaced
- **Resource Trading**: Players can trade resources with other slaves or guards

### Progression Systems
1. **Mining Skill**: Increases with experience, improving efficiency
2. **Physical Condition**: Affects stamina and resistance to hazards
3. **Social Standing**: Determines interactions with other characters
4. **Knowledge of Events**: Affects narrative choices and opportunities

### Upgrades
1. **Better Tools**: Increases mining efficiency
2. **Living Quarters**: Improves rest quality and health regeneration
3. **Connections**: Opens new trading and information opportunities
4. **Skills**: Mining, crafting, medical, and language skills
5. **Bribery**: Using silver to gain favors from guards and overseers

## Narrative Integration

### News and Rumors
- Players receive news from the frontier through various channels:
  - New slaves arriving at the mine
  - Guards discussing military matters
  - Merchants bringing supplies
  - Official announcements from mine administrators

### Parallel Storyline
- The player's story runs parallel to the main events of "The Grass Crown"
- Key events from the novel become turning points in the game:
  - Tribal movements beyond the Danube
  - The plague affecting Roman forces
  - The winter settlement arrangement
  - The spring thaw and withdrawal

### Character Connections
- Players may encounter minor characters connected to the main story
- Some decisions may have small influences on events in the main narrative
- Players gradually piece together the larger geopolitical situation

### Player Choices
- Strategic decisions about resource allocation
- Moral choices about helping or competing with other slaves
- Loyalty decisions: Rome, tribes, or self-preservation
- Escape attempts vs. working toward manumission (freedom)

## Game Progression Timeline

### Early Game (Chapter 1-3 Content)
- Player learns basic mining mechanics
- Establishes survival routines
