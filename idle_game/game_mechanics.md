# Game Mechanics and Progression Plan

## Core Game Mechanics

### Resource Collection Mechanics
1. **Automatic Mining**
   - Base collection rate: 1 silver ore per 10 seconds
   - Passive collection continues when game is closed (offline progress)
   - Maximum offline collection capacity: 2 hours initially, upgradable

2. **Active Mining (Click Mechanics)**
   - Each click yields 1 silver ore
   - Click efficiency upgrades increase yield per click
   - Clicking stamina system: 20 clicks before efficiency drops by 50%
   - Stamina regenerates at 1 unit per 30 seconds

3. **Mining Shifts**
   - Day shift (6am-6pm): Standard mining rates
   - Night shift (6pm-6am): +25% silver yield but -25% stamina
   - Special shifts: Overseer inspections, emergency quotas

4. **Mine Hazards**
   - Random events trigger every 5-10 minutes
   - Types: Cave-ins, flooding, tool breakage, guard harassment
   - Hazard resistance increases with upgrades and skills
   - Successful hazard management yields bonus resources

### Resource Management Mechanics

1. **Survival Needs**
   - Food depletes at 1 unit per minute
   - Water depletes at 2 units per minute
   - Below 20% food/water: Mining efficiency -50%
   - At 0% food/water: Health begins to deplete

2. **Health System**
   - Maximum health: 100 points
   - Health depletes from hazards, lack of food/water, overwork
   - Health regenerates at 1 point per minute when resting
   - Below 50% health: Mining efficiency -25%
   - At 0% health: Player is sent to infirmary (production halts for 1 hour)

3. **Tool Durability**
   - Tools have 100 durability points
   - Durability decreases by 1 point per minute while mining
   - Broken tools reduce mining efficiency by 75%
   - Repair costs increase with tool quality

4. **Trading System**
   - Daily trader visits with randomized offers
   - Trade ratios fluctuate based on game events
   - Special trades available based on reputation and progress

## Progression Systems

### Character Progression

1. **Mining Skill Levels**
   - Levels 1-50
   - Each level provides +2% mining efficiency
   - Milestone levels (10, 25, 50) unlock special abilities
   - Experience gained through active mining

2. **Physical Condition**
   - Strength: Affects carrying capacity and click power
   - Endurance: Affects stamina regeneration and hazard resistance
   - Health: Affects recovery rate and maximum health
   - Attributes improve through work and proper resource management

3. **Social Standing**
   - Reputation with guards (0-100)
   - Reputation with fellow slaves (0-100)
   - Reputation with mine administrator (0-100)
   - Higher reputation unlocks new interactions and opportunities

4. **Knowledge System**
   - Mining knowledge: Improves efficiency and unlocks new techniques
   - Roman knowledge: Improves interactions with guards and officials
   - Tribal knowledge: Provides context for news and special abilities
   - Medical knowledge: Improves health management and healing

### Upgrade Paths

1. **Tool Progression**
   - Wooden pick → Iron pick → Steel pick → Silver-inlaid pick
   - Each tier increases base mining rate by 50%
   - Higher tiers have better durability and special properties

2. **Living Quarters**
   - Shared barracks → Private corner → Small cell → Comfortable quarters
   - Better quarters improve rest quality and health regeneration
   - Higher tiers provide storage for more resources

3. **Connections Network**
   - Fellow slaves → Friendly guard → Merchant contact → Administrator's assistant
   - Each connection provides unique benefits and information
   - Network expands through reputation and strategic choices

4. **Skill Specializations**
   - Mining specialist: Focus on resource collection efficiency
   - Craftsman: Focus on tool durability and creation
   - Medic: Focus on health management and healing
   - Diplomat: Focus on social interactions and information gathering

## Prestige System (Long-term Progression)
- After achieving freedom, players can start a new game with prestige bonuses
- Prestige points are earned based on total silver mined, days survived, and narrative choices
- Each prestige point provides permanent bonuses to resource collection and survival
- Prestige system ensures long-term engagement beyond the main narrative

## Balancing Principles
1. **Resource Equilibrium**: Input/output ratios balanced to create meaningful choices
2. **Time-Value Scaling**: Upgrades follow logarithmic cost scaling for smooth progression
3. **Risk-Reward Mechanics**: Higher risk activities provide proportionally higher rewards
4. **Multiple Viable Strategies**: Different specialization paths are equally viable
5. **Narrative Pacing**: Story revelations timed to maintain interest throughout progression

## Difficulty Options
1. **Survivor Mode**: Harsher survival requirements, fewer resources
2. **Standard Mode**: Balanced experience as described above
3. **Story Mode**: Reduced survival pressure, focus on narrative elements
