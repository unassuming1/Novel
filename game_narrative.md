# The Grass Crown: Idle Game Narrative Elements

## Game Concept
An idle game where the player takes on the role of a slave working in a Roman silver mine during the Marcomannic Wars (170-180 CE). As the player progresses through the game, they hear stories about General Titus Aelius Gallus and his exploits on the Danube frontier, connecting the slave's struggle for survival with the larger historical narrative.

## Setting
- **Primary Setting**: A Roman silver mine in Hispania (modern-day Spain)
- **Time Period**: 170-180 CE, concurrent with the events of The Grass Crown novel
- **Historical Context**: The Marcomannic Wars, the Antonine Plague, and the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius

## Player Character
- A slave assigned to work in the silver mines
- No formal name (player can choose or remains unnamed as a representation of the countless forgotten individuals who supported Rome's economy)
- Goal: Survive the harsh conditions while potentially working toward freedom
- Connection to main story: Hears news and stories about General Titus's campaigns from soldiers, merchants, and other slaves

## Key Narrative Elements to Incorporate

### 1. The Mine Setting
- Harsh working conditions that deteriorate as resources are diverted to the war effort
- Hierarchical structure: Roman overseers, skilled freedmen miners, and slaves
- Different mine sections unlock as the game progresses (deeper tunnels, smelting areas, storage)

### 2. News from the Frontier
- Reports arrive periodically about General Titus's campaigns
- Each major battle or event from the novel becomes a news item that affects the mine
- The Antonine Plague eventually reaches the mines, creating new challenges

### 3. Character Connections
- **Mine Overseer**: Former soldier who served under Titus, provides firsthand accounts
- **Merchant**: Brings news from Rome, including political machinations against Titus
- **New Slaves**: Arrive with stories from different parts of the empire
- **Visiting Official**: Occasionally inspects the mine, bringing direct orders or news from the Emperor

### 4. Parallel Story Progression
- As Titus faces challenges on the frontier, the mine faces its own difficulties
- The player's survival mirrors Titus's struggle to maintain his legion
- The philosophical elements of stoicism can be discovered by the player character
